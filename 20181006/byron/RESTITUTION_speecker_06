15:05:001046:001046_2 : 15:03:46:417: Ok so I'm sticking with a q r d . 2
15:05:001047:001047_3 : 15:03:56:359: We're going to speak in English we also speak French so if any time with questions in English or French . 3
15:05:001048:001048_4 : 15:04:06:486: Which is an archival project and we were both the product itself and what it is to do with fighting and with vital source code . 4
15:05:001049:001049_0 : 15:04:18:514: I've been doing a free software and open source for almost 20 years now and I made a fair to say that these days I can we have a little bit at least a free software in every product we use softer ASDA 373 softer in there is not entirely. That's a shame for me but it's it's it's really something that you never i t crowd that
15:06:001050:001050_2 : 15:04:42:642: And we usually think about that piece of software that we all collectively publish and develop together as something which is quite functional so we usually think at free software as something that it's made and suffering general to make a computer do something for you be a game machine something . 2
15:06:001051:001051_0 : 15:05:05:776: What is important here in A13 like today is that in feet after and specifically can Source Code which is worth. It allows you to see modify share and Sonic forces also a knowledge so that you can see and read us some information there which might be very very novel in a couple of example here so when example is from the source code of quake . 3
15:06:001052:001052_0 : 15:05:33:911: Network in Linux end in itself they're not. But what I'm going to say about these is that they were very novel technique it was not known before or at the time . 4
15:07:001053:001053_1 : 15:05:49:046: Ways of rendering 3D . 1
15:07:001054:001054_2 : 15:05:53:171: Which was something we should my been presented as a computer science conference on 3D rendering . 2
15:07:001055:001055_3 : 15:06:02:310: Lyrics for actually deliver a package packages metapackages is very house very high throughput which was not known at the time so pretty much as we cherish novel discoveries scientific conferences we need to understand that we might have the same level of novelty and of knowledge in Source Code itself so even if you do not trust her so she might be valuable The Peace of God exist . 3
15:07:001056:001056_0 : 15:06:29:433: Learn something from it another example if you wanted you know the decision which maybe we can be deferred innovation which we no longer have any pictures of their kids 50 years now because maybe touring pitches in 4 months and we will not know how to decode them 100 years 50 years from now if you had a piece of course is able to decode
15:08:001057:001057_1 : 15:06:57:560: Make a specific issues they can tell you because someone down the line out resume . 1
15:08:001058:001058_2 : 15:07:06:693: Here is that we are collecting the development and you kind of Commons which didn't exist like one of the year in the bath ok so every time we publish with a line under a free license we are collectively contribute into a piece of knowledge which is here it is here to last is not something that people that do not know programming know how to exploit but if something's . 2
15:08:001059:001059_3 : 15:07:31:813: Do know people that can learn for me will be able to use in the future . 3
15:08:001060:001060_4 : 15:07:38:935: Look at this thing is being called this offer essentially is a collective Good Witch tech people and developers are creating together every time they do a git push for every time they publish his back at work creating . 4
15:09:001061:001061_1 : 15:07:56:051: If we agree that is something important the question is are we taking good care of this offer such as we care about anything and . 1
15:09:001062:001062_2 : 15:08:08:175: Keeping you safe spots or areas or a Call of Duty all that kind of stuff we need to care about this . 2
15:09:001063:001063_3 : 15:08:16:300: Be possible if this is a share the source if it is a comment that you may need to enter text people can access and should be able to benefit from where is the place where you can go and actually do something with his collective body of knowledge what is the place where you can search all the libraries all the programs that you care about ok but not all this was casino . 3
15:09:001064:001064_4 : 15:08:45:429: Time . 4
15:10:001065:001065_1 : 15:08:48:570: Not all this is on github at Speen parish and we'll be publishing the future so if you want a single place where you can browse and look for something which has been discussed you don't have this play . 1
15:10:001066:001066_2 : 15:09:02:356: Even more so . 2
15:10:001067:001067_3 : 15:09:05:501: Places that are used to collectively develop source code was cold and tooth abscess can disappear for various reasons with being some commercial services been destroyed by a tax fine catering services used to be called spaces with seen a natural business decision which of the shutdown of 4 years ago I was very excited because . 3
15:10:001068:001068_4 : 15:09:35:644: Places that are used to collectively develops was cold and tooth abscess can disappear for various reasons with being some commercial services been destroyed by a tax fine catering services used to be called spaces with seen a natural business decision which of the shutdown of 4 years ago The doughnuts previous Appearances been bought by get up and with everyone because of inability time frame left but should still do something with your code is actually pretty small and Google Code went away as well, so Google was offering this whole thing and service for for free and some point they decided that he couldn't make money out of it . 4
15:10:001069:001069_1 : 15:09:58:859: You can no longer a push to the repository Donnelly some point inside the well you can still access to call but your just talk anymore and it's . 1
15:11:001070:001070_2 : 15:10:10:986: Shutdown computer . 2
15:11:001071:001071_3 : 15:10:14:113: It's fine it is there digital my decision but we might have lost something in the process . 3
15:11:001072:001072_4 : 15:10:22:242: You have services that archive other staff references need . 4
15:11:001073:001073_1 : 15:10:29:375: If a single get up you prefer Siri or a single rear coilovers the entire Austin place for software Source Code goes away . 1
15:12:001074:001074_2 : 15:10:39:521: So I'm kind of in computer science and kind of curvy time use of my colleagues in physics which are good at essentially building shared her research infrastructure that they can use together think of the lxc you think of the big telescope in the atacama desert . 2
15:12:001075:001075_3 : 15:10:58:655: Paula use a mosasaurus is built built shirts activities which are usually even hated by international agreements and Wear NE4 research you can disappear for sometime of using their sauces go the experiment and when you're done someone else is going to use the same as when I'm . 3
15:12:001076:001076_4 : 15:11:17:778: I dream of a place where I can go maybe some other sources and you don't do an experiment mean doing a big glass on all this as good as ever been published see if my phone is cracked and then you know about myself and someone else we just use the same without needing to recreate the same . 4
15:13:001077:001077_1 : 15:11:40:906: Essentially this answering these use cases is what we have been doing at the Sofware Heritage over the past couple of weeks . 1
15:13:001078:001078_2 : 15:11:52:040: Is essentially a project with a mission of collecting preserving and sharing all this was girl that has ever been published with the word and anyone who needs to accept . 2
15:13:001079:001079_3 : 15:12:04:067: What we want to do is actually super support different use cases so we had this mission of collecting and preserving insurance was good and we do that for various reasons the first one is preservation for preserving our technical knowledge an hour contract so we Claim that was not binary . 3
15:14:001080:001080_4 : 15:12:26:197: We do not want to do it even if you are not useful for anything else even just doing the preservation for proficiency would be something very bad so it's actually really care about the research you scared which I just described so we want to enable researchers to adjust the office on the entire body of swords . 4
15:14:001081:001081_1 : 15:12:49:330: Patient UK especially if you follow the computer science curriculum you know these are not at school using ontology and other disciplines are we don't tell me no place where we go and go through the evolution of implementation techniques for specific and we do that . 1
15:14:001082:001082_2 : 15:13:07:452: Reference to real code and how you know techniques 36 and the simulation of a bowl of their time so we believe the something like a big caboose of Source Code can be the basis on which it ok to still this kind of ontologies for . 2
15:14:001083:001083_3 : 15:13:23:579: Ok for some industrial use cases specifically it's very hard for all the companies that are embedding free sofa in their products to know which specific version of library of a snippet or whatever they are embedded in a . 3
15:15:001084:001084_4 : 15:13:39:696: I'm free software to cheat on girls on diesel emissions in your car's how do you know which specific version of the library of you sexually you know it called your mother's from the market when someone catch you for that reason so if we can do if you have a huge cars you can give out as identifiers . 4
15:15:001085:001085_1 : 15:14:00:817: Ship Inn n e a t crowd following some very strong design principles not a BTEC Level in sorry but at the institutional and and management level if you want so first of all we are doing all this in Italian Italian open approach to believe the mission is important enough for doing that ain't out using for softer . 1
15:15:001086:001086_2 : 15:14:26:966: Archiving rendering and preserving and Siri searching on the kodi it's entire different softer and we are trying to use the you know the usual models with learn from comments Wars collectors and someone you know that you've been doing that yourself for quite a while I'm guessing . 2
15:15:001087:001087_3 : 15:14:47:099: Something which is meant to exist in a very long term . 3
15:16:001088:001088_4 : 15:14:53:229: Sing we can to maximise the chances that nothing would be lost so of course it's a very simple back as level what you want to do is having as many copies as possible so the idea that they we don't want to have a single copy that is under our control we going to have a worldwide network which is under control of different entities which keep copies of your card so that no single . 4
15:16:001089:001089_1 : 15:15:16:342: Nothing given institutional change in law that might make it difficult to do presentation will be an Appaloosa . 1
15:16:001090:001090_2 : 15:15:25:473: Nothing given institutional change in law that might make it difficult to We're creating this as a non-profit introduced to not be good for profit in East either bad or anything but because the goals of companies and corporation changed much more quickly than the goal of non-profit organisation dedicated to a single mission so this is going to be and forever going to be a non-profit . 2
15:16:001091:001091_3 : 15:15:45:336: Let me give you some more details of what you're doing . 3
15:16:001092:001092_4 : 15:15:51:466: Reserve swash got together with the history of its development want to be able to people to enable people to FIFA version control system or if your sister disappear want to enable them to reconstruct the full list of development and rate of development from that pocket so what that means that we go around looking for places where do Skoda CZ develop for this or disabled . 4
15:17:001093:001093_1 : 15:16:17:601: We go there and we archive all the following formation the content of all the Source Code side sweetheart . 1
15:17:001094:001094_2 : 15:16:27:726: Postcode treat if I should eat at any point . 2
15:17:001095:001095_3 : 15:16:33:854: Medium . 3
15:17:001096:001096_4 : 15:16:35:971: African so we are coming or Limited . 4
15:18:001097:001097_1 : 15:16:41:103: Specific comments we've been tagged as being an important my from the project and in addition we store all fitting information so where and when we archive any one of those different type of artefacts found in the way we do that using . 1
15:18:001098:001098_2 : 15:16:59:216: Which is able to store the details of a git repository of a parable of a dado stack edge of a pipe I archive or observation in a single people migrate to PC . 2
15:18:001099:001099_3 : 15:17:01:216:  We will not have to be now we Are What We DO NOT archive is everything else like we do not archive back racking systems reviews . 3
15:18:001100:001100_4 : 15:17:29:527: Website and try and support because they're not imported we know they're very important for development purposes but we feel that already the mission of archiving sauce with is quite challenging so we do not want a piece of this stage to go through some sort of Mission creep and stress yourself and still doing to play well with ours is making it possible to pinpoint any artefact . 4
15:19:001101:001101_1 : 15:17:54:640: So that you are doing while others are archiving those kind of things they can usually do some cross matching and say hey it was this project back in 2018 called Daddy and now we're in 3040 doesn't . 1
15:19:001102:001102_2 : 15:18:10:785: Share this with Twitter accounts are as a heritage . 2

15:19:001104:001104_4 : 15:18:26:056: Similar to a web crawler but we start from a selected list of what you waiting list of art so we have a semi-automated listing which you can say there is a force there which is of a specific type or there is a package manager repository there a specific type and Perry go through all this distribution play any single places . 4
15:19:001105:001105_1 : 15:18:52:175: List all the softer hygiene certificate findings on github it's something like something that can list all the git repository Debian is something you can do sausages to do this . 1
15:19:001106:001106_2 : 15:19:09:312: Ready for the . 2
15:20:001107:001107_3 : 15:19:13:440: Leeds departure status of the hygiene might need a URL of a specific . 3

15:22:001113:001113_1 : 15:20:01:302: When did that was in itself is a Big Mac attack saying that the structure with finding itself in blockchains and speak about these days so I guess you can't see much of the little thing with this projection but essentially is that is a big marker structure in which have leaves which are just accountant of the fight without any name identified by Jackson ok if I'm out . 1
15:22:001114:001114_2 : 15:20:27:429: Body of additional checks on to avoid collisions . 2
15:22:001115:001115_4 : 15:20:32:554: Directors in cells and you go up your valuable with the revisions which are comets you got up again at 2 objective record Nexus which are essentially the full state of a given repository or or sausages so for instance think of the case of Gates net worth of a git repository is a picture in which we have for each branch for each tag object it's What is this interesting is that even is the git repository deleted or if you have changed the Easter in somebody Stratford Manor doing repairs or treating grandson as if we never remove the old maps so if you remove stuff you can still have the picture of their thoughts before your mobile so you will be able to find stuff that maybe you deleted by mistake and left on . 4
15:22:001116:001116_1 : 15:21:24:934: Vrv the shape of the equivalent of a small calendar that for each softer hygiene tells you when we visited it and for each time someone with this is it points to a snapshot which allows you to retrieve everything accessible from from that visit with . 1
15:22:001117:001117_2 : 15:21:42:050: Something that exist for real it's been going on in the Beano cutting stuff for the past couple of years so we ever get tired more more than 5 billion unique to Ascot fight because we did everything thanks to the structure with more than 1 billion unique me coming from more than 80 million projects . 2
15:23:001118:001118_0 : 15:22:03:170: SE1 each difficulty with a project which package is a project and so on so far

15:24:001122:001122_3 : 15:22:50:640: Working on archiving bitbucket so it's ready today the largest source codec ID that exist in the world it's big it's not that big compared to your video project is something else of 20 terabyte in terms of content and the structure is not a base which is something I see if you look at the graph itself . 3
15:24:001123:001123_4 : 15:23:16:762: The grass is 10 billion notes and more than 100 billion edges so it's pretty interesting been scanned of challenging to to the width and is growing daily so periodically we add new origins of weird news for new version . 4
15:24:001124:001124_1 : 15:23:35:879: Stan Getz and account . 1
15:24:001125:001125_2 : 15:23:40:032: What can you do with this today to do the weather be like that you can use watch me navigate to The Rock that is not a wine API which is made to . 2
15:25:001126:001126_3 : 15:23:52:152: Scale analysis of the content of their side but starting from any point so you can do stuff like ok tell me all the visits you ever forgive of Origin will give you that allow you to go through the graph down to the individual . 3
15:25:001127:001127_0 : 15:24:08:283: You can find it the commander Data archive society.org any point which is both for the . 4
15:25:001128:001128_1 : 15:24:16:386: And also for our interface you can download so here is my post been deleted for whatever reason can you can you give me the entire state of the repository at the last visit you use . 1
15:26:001129:001129_2 : 15:24:36:505: It's not practical to use the API to do that because you will have to be not download every single upset one by one . 2

15:26:001131:001131_4 : 15:25:08:726: Can you can import the kit bundle Darcy locally and you start developing from there and the last way with opened up a few months ago for navigating through is actually a proper web interface so it's you are familiar with the internet archive wayback machine is something which is very similar so you start from the URL of your software version that you can find using some Foo . 4
15:26:001132:001132_2 : 15:25:31:845: Can you can import the kit bundle Darcy locally and you start developing from there and the last way with opened up a few months ago for navigating through is actually a proper web interface so it's you are familiar with the internet archive wayback machine is something which is very similar so you start from the URL of your software version Also access to a calendar to show you every time with visited it and use you pick a visit and then you ever get up like interface allows you to navigate through the fire to the comments and Swansea and that is accessible starting from our kind of traitor . 2
15:27:001133:001133_3 : 15:25:55:228: That's it for a general overview and Nicolae Guta will tell you more about the fire . 3

15:27:001135:001135_2 : 15:26:35:587: Archive and then big mess in the Middle with . 2
15:27:001136:001136_3 : 15:26:42:706: BBC list of that create regions in the database and crawler loaders that will allow the origins so . 3
15:27:001137:001137_4 : 15:26:54:812: What we're doing for the Beta distribution . 4
15:27:001138:001138_1 : 15:27:01:708: Stop is actually sting order Python modules that exist on the baby are cats so . 1
15:28:001139:001139_2 : 15:27:09:831: Inside the swh list all modules Python as well so what is software heritage listed as basically it pros and ounces of cream cheese and turns that list of projects into regions that are low dose can understand and can work on . 2
15:28:001140:001140_3 : 15:27:33:605: Loading tasks that are fed into the schedule mechanism to actually lose their contents of . 3
15:28:001141:001141_4 : 15:27:41:724: The most of the credit goes to have you got man who did the list of scaffolding so all the base layers for the implementation and I'll send you . 4
