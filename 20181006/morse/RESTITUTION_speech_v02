11:03:000232:000232_3 : 11:03:22:276: Thank you I am not able . 3
11:04:000233:000233_4 : 11:03:44:429: No thank . 4
11:04:000234:000234_1 : 11:03:50:329: Good morning everyone thank you all for coming to the stop I might you saying are from India and I'm currently majoring in computer science and engineering and will be graduating next to you so they stopped up and I'm like currently working on a research Lab golf club in New Delhi and lab is basically working on it on my speakers so and for the past few months happy Loss of vision deep are busy planning which has been quite active . 2
11:05:000236:000236_0 : 11:04:25:722: D.va why is it so so . 3
11:05:000237:000237_4 : 11:04:31:869: Ok so to start with slight the current state of our machine learning and deep learning tech models is that we are not able to do you actually see these Morrison not actually able to tell us about the uncertainties and son been one of the main factors for these models that we actually want to know that what is more models don't don't understand and for the CIA . 4
11:05:000238:000238_1 : 11:05:04:005: Is up like a beauty an approach to the authors deep learning and the machine learning and Sophie is machine learning and deep learning applications are a cross with seals in Lakeside Vanguard healthcare and a long long with which country makes it easier with critical applications and so we have to be very certain about the you know about the predictions old is Zola Budd out for . 1
11:05:000239:000239_2 : 11:05:05:005: What is a giving and therefore we have to basically tell . 2
11:06:000240:000240_3 : 11:05:39:353: 14th chapter of these models . 3
11:06:000241:000241_4 : 11:05:43:504: Lexus was the news from biggest 2015/16 when this was the first fatal crash today slow card and some reason which of the car which for a photograph was that the car was not able to distinguish between the you play cowboy tractors and then the white Skype so look for these reasons of you know . 4
11:06:000242:000242_1 : 11:06:09:664: Beep like the things which lead to this kind of cases is very important . 1
11:06:000243:000243_2 : 11:06:17:795: What differences do like what is uncertainty and that's why it is important so uncertainty fiscal that's do you know the dictionary meaning of the same . 2
11:07:000244:000244_0 : 11:06:29:921: You're not 100/:/ sure. What are output is at the state of being under 18 . 3
11:07:000245:000245_0 : 11:06:37:420: And so in deep learning I will be with you talking about are two main types of uncertainties which the first one is a lot of the daily toric uncertainty and setting the second one is the second one is epistemic so in aleatory uncertainty be into metres. What we cannot understand from our data so things like garlic occlusion allocation stop using a lack of under over the . 4
11:07:000246:000246_0 : 11:07:06:548: Areas in our data so we need to understand these things so we can see in this example. . 1
11:07:000247:000247_2 : 11:07:13:675: Other kind of overlapping so we are sure you're not very sure these two cars with overlapping so we can do it we have to take these things into account and . 2
11:08:000248:000248_3 : 11:07:27:821: Open 13th is the epistemic which which tends to measure that what we are like the Nordic what cases are models not able to . 3
11:08:000249:000249_4 : 11:07:40:966: 02392 the main reason for the same could be allowed to have you know the training data for the same so this is very good example for somewhere we have these in Port images and so this is a image segmentation example of every pixel is classified into 13 classes and you can see that you're in this daily toric uncertainty over the borders of like these our letters and it . 4
11:09:000250:000250_0 : 11:08:10:093: The model is quite uncertain about the data because that's kind of click here we have in the book Fusions and stuff like that and then in epistemic uncertainty we can see that in this party food bad things like it's quite uncertain that whether it's a footpath because because this one is not rain for food. So it's quite certain about things like us or Europe reason stuff like that but . 1
11:09:000251:000251_2 : 11:08:11:093: Video on talking about the football tonight so this is what we are aiming to this is what we aim for using this application . 2
11:09:000252:000252_3 : 11:08:45:356: Love you so so basically know what we want is a suit know what we wanted something where we can have you nobody feels deep learning and then we can be sleeping the uncertainty thing and for the same what we have is a bayesian probability Theory which we will be using along with the Deep learning which which combines to make the bayesian Deep learning . 3
11:09:000253:000253_4 : 11:09:12:486: Ok and I . 4
11:10:000254:000254_1 : 11:09:16:165: Sort yourself before you move on to the vision things so let's try to just I see the basics of the conventional unit works soap sud neural networks are nothing but you're not a series of linear transformations which can be accomplished by Simple matrix multiplication so so here we have so the function f basically X X X X Factor with the Wi-Fi and then adds a 2 DB when we . 1
11:10:000255:000255_2 : 11:09:47:296: Oliver chicken Caesar disfigure like this gets multiplied to this then we add a device to it and then we get the intermediate output which will then throw the ball so like we have things like dinosaur daily which are simply like Activision Blizzard to bring the non-linearity in . 2
11:11:000256:000256_3 : 11:10:09:451: The one making me to think which we have here is that we tend to have with switch off . 3
11:11:000257:000257_4 : 11:10:10:451: Play The Wave salon which featured video of you know this would be very discreet so this would be very specific values of sorting values for a particular deep learning models but the main difference which comes in the bayesian neural network is not installed as a discrete of weights and biases we having to clean makeup you make or distribution nor did we try to learn . 4
11:11:000258:000258_8 : 11:10:46:775: Are these weights and biases to install with cleaning up like just 0.8 and 3.1 we will kind of be built into you no longer a distribution over these weights and biases so so make sure all these are weights and biases just turns into a distribution probability distribution . 1
11:12:000259:000259_2 : 11:11:09:922: Yes so now at the very heart of these are like the bayesian probability Theory is this is a classical piece still them witches like Robbie of a given B is the probability of B given into probability of a and then รท property of be so please don't say that mean Family part is that we tend to learn return to basically no surprises for the Portuguese and with Intent . 2
11:12:000260:000260_3 : 11:11:43:052: Do you know these two are fostered over to the final output which he was so the procedure is the big data distribution which we are trying to find and then we have a prior that can be any any distribution abortion or anything like that and the likelihood is the . 3
11:12:000261:000261_4 : 11:12:04:190: Mistley what's the likelihood that giving something for giving a what is likelihood that we are going to get beef and then this is evidence which is the probability of be so when we see this in terms of machine learning and deep learning models of what we have is the Galaxy 2 on DVD these are basically which we are trying to learn from a model and then this is the date . 4
11:13:000262:000262_1 : 11:12:31:342: Singing potato with a baby have . 1
11:13:000263:000263_0 : 11:12:36:488: Visiter little likelihood functions prior probabilities and then the posterior distribution which we are trying to find so innocuous so let me know when when we optimise are the only models that we have to optimise ticket are tomatoes on the way to make 3 to 39. . 2
11:13:000264:000264_3 : 11:12:59:619: That's what does the posterior distribution that we are like we're trying to find probability distribution over you know that was given the data and here we have the like the prior probability which we insulate suppose we take a question distribution without me touching me and we didn't talk all the weights and biases and . 3
11:13:000265:000265_4 : 11:13:24:777: Problem with this flex with the bass time in terms of . 4
11:14:000266:000266_1 : 11:13:30:925: That is the is this time maybe off the witches are evidence and it's just a constraint suno the problem is that this can also be written as we receive the return to find . 1
11:14:000267:000267_2 : 11:13:45:067: And other data or overwriting next in Port 8000 given what I was up late for all day look for all the parameters which we have this tends to be an interactable problem because you know they would be in final distributed some beach at the time we arrived so so this is one of the major problems which we know which we have to solve when we are using this when we are using . 2
11:14:000268:000268_3 : 11:14:12:187: M40 clear case . 3
11:14:000269:000269_0 : 11:14:16:318: What we are flights to solve this weekend to use an approximation techniques which which will kind of do sampling over the sporty clothes of you know in 48 hour and will try to give us an approximate value for this protocol constant and I will be free to SCART to Aldi's of places to visit between you and which I would be discussing in
11:15:000270:000270_0 : 11:14:47:440: Cancel this world drive from DVR cont.ws drive from the radiation in Sydney . 1
11:15:000271:000271_0 : 11:14:55:124: Swingarm send video to influence what we say is that ok so so we have to find out probability distribution like the probability distribution of weight given our data so we tend to take orders you may probability distribution with security. And I've basically our aim is to optimise like what it will be assumed to the final value which is the posterior distribution on for this . 2
11:16:000272:000272_3 : 11:15:23:253: Take the kill me trick with a scale divergence which tells us that you know how close are how far these distributions are so you can see that up to optimise our palomitas mean to minimise a sloth build a wooden floors football boot these distributions . 3
11:16:000273:000273_4 : 11:15:46:127: The problem with this was that are so this win between are modelled using the video shoes in French means to be a bit slow and also potentially bit slow so so later one of the techniques which was proposed I use in 2000 . 4
11:16:000274:000274_1 : 11:16:06:255: 2015 link June 2015 by Aaron carlito vs Monte Carlo Dropout techniques so what do you propose to go that are so they gave the protocol finding that we can use drop out which is a very famous You are in the deep learning models to basically or basically find deviations between France and . 2
11:17:000276:000276_3 : 11:16:35:567: Distributions over it and . 3
11:17:000277:000277_4 : 11:16:40:719: How to do like the idea behind this like why they were using Dropout by the way using drop out with let's just see that how they work Dropout looks like so ok so we use regularization techniques in business so that we don't like them being so that we don't all fit on a keto which means that we are . 4
11:18:000278:000278_1 : 11:17:10:863: Play George on delays over a data on 02 model shoot John Lewis over the data not simply you know Roseland Lake the input data which it has and for the same so like we had these are Leos with the Neurons and every new line is the interdependent on each other and so what we do is not simply random movie drop some of the neurone soma to select during our training face for you try to eat . 1
11:18:000279:000279_2 : 11:17:38:995: If we ignore her simply as you go out around instructions of the neurone from my body and then weekly train ticket money for the same and then during our testing fees or so doing this thing Tuesday morning good looks like same like it or it will have all the notes as we just have to accept it or with invoices with the liquid . 2
11:18:000280:000280_5 : 11:18:03:137: For example if we take like a fraction of 50/:/ so I need to be doing the training phase we will simply drop you know 50/:/ of neurone soma models and when we using our doing the testing phase when we when we will get define lodges are the new the final output we will just multiply all these with 0.5 just two Factor . 3
11:18:000281:000281_4 : 11:18:30:279: We have a new job some of the neurones are you during the training phase . 4
11:19:000282:000282_1 : 11:18:37:097: Yes or the main idea behind this like using Dropout four legs video videos free . 1
11:19:000283:000283_0 : 11:18:48:234: So are the daughters said. So suppose selective look at Dropout technique what we're doing is basically a new dawn it's a corner off . 2
11:20:000284:000284_3 : 11:19:01:386: Dr Peter switching on article on your own or we are turning it off so it's kind of a pine tree things like 0 or 1 and which can be seen which is very similar to the police . 3
11:20:000285:000285_4 : 11:19:33:512: Swing video snow in France we were basically as you mean a particular distribution which we were going to further optimised so that it gets close to the final distribution between want and to hear that distribution would ba banana ba banana distribution and . 4
11:20:000286:000286_1 : 11:19:56:650: Thought it would be so that they could be used to perform door video selling friends and serious decision which sea is between our case will be up on a lead to serious thought this was the kind of intuition . 1
11:20:000287:000287_2 : 11:20:13:803: Lake around which the LEGO people live around but it's quite an intense if not so that you can always look to this like this paper which so they have proved everything like why the property would tend to you don't give us the same results as a ratio in French . 2
11:21:000288:000288_3 : 11:20:37:328: So also find . 3
11:21:000289:000289_4 : 11:20:50:470: Let's just look at the sample code snippet for you for free meeting this month Alicante Dropout techniques so I have so the problem seems that we have a simple of you know we are using a simple model Elena's Models and which is a very basic one and we are applying this to the MOT status 8 which is Which is like a charge does hydrogen desert images around Lake 60000 m . 4
11:21:000290:000290_1 : 11:21:23:605: Ignore spin the wheel spin classes . 1
11:22:000291:000291_0 : 11:21:28:755: So simply are you going to see that this this is a basic architecture which has two countries then to fully connected layers and here can see that. We apply drop out to be Buddies with the property of with 20/:/ where are we dropping out 20/:/ of . 2
11:22:000292:000292_3 : 11:21:50:901: And finally like so this what is entitled to choose a deep learning framework for implementing this and so so here we simply sweet biscuit be a defining great dane for Poole departures we are so this is the Living put down the target disk optimisation then . 3
11:22:000293:000293_4 : 11:22:14:045: Play me train or optimise like it's very basic training step and finally finally in the testing things so what we have to do is that of when we test we basically take 10 samples Southend Echo variable amount of titration so suppose we take out food for 20 cases and then we will be refined what's the mean and the variance for that particular Alexa IV chloride racing . 4
11:23:000294:000294_1 : 11:22:45:190: I'd love to all of you can see that we take this article 102 103 since we will find the output which is the largest . 1
11:23:000295:000295_2 : 11:22:56:340: The mean and the variance which is given to the higher we didn't mean that the uncertainty is quite high and the Lotus which means that the world is quite confident for the same . 2
11:24:000296:000296_3 : 11:23:12:477: So these are the outputs so so this is like the 2 digit which is like these photos are very similar to the original video and Alfie deyes images with C that David in Staines to increase which state is that the uncertainty model is getting uncertain about whatever predictions it is it's making . 3
11:24:000297:000297_4 : 11:23:40:617: Lily of the case with six so take these are not the most pretty confident about these cases and as you rotate them for that gets you know I'm sorting and obedience 10 string cheese and I just forgot to mention one thing to sleep in networks in any machine learning deep Learning Network the probability . 4
11:24:000298:000298_5 : 11:24:04:765: Put on pictures of lactating is different from uncertainty because so that the justices that they come so I suppose if you have 2 3 glasses and it says that they are probably for fast is 21.5 and 10.4 or distributing just telling that it's . 1
11:24:000300:000300_2 : 11:24:27:921: Stop not sorting but it says I owe its profitability that this would be like this with the class and legs 1 . 2
11:25:000301:000301_3 : 11:24:39:554: Thank you . 3
11:25:000302:000302_4 : 11:24:44:683: Set a sleep I would be putting the whole course of these are just some of the coats of it you can always like this and I will be putting all the references which are used when I was exploring the spheres on the espresso . 4
11:25:000303:000303_1 : 11:25:01:752: Yeah . 1
11:25:000304:000304_2 : 11:25:10:883: Yes or no question is that select what are the outputs before and after we are applying the . 2
11:26:000305:000305_3 : 11:25:35:026: You're actually I don't have the link I don't have those images which were before they say biscuit . 3
11:26:000306:000306_4 : 11:25:46:162: Images of before and after that report but they can be played in the sides I'm just showing the output after drop out so maybe I can make sure you got to the top so this diesel after the drop out and so before drop soup before Dropout V we won't be getting any uncertainty of eating sing we wish we getting the probability of the property for this particular so so we have 10 . 4
11:26:000307:000307_1 : 11:25:46:162: 9 visits so we will be getting a property just like a property for each class looking for drop out using before letter about you so when we use Dropout readjust or readjust wing or something things he takes 1400 outputs and then simply find the variance in them which tends to give us the the uncertainty for that . 1
11:27:000308:000308_2 : 11:26:36:538: We thought you know that the output like before drop out and the after drop out . 2
11:27:000309:000309_3 : 11:26:44:683: How to listen to . 3
11:27:000310:000310_4 : 11:26:47:996: Of . 4
11:33:000311:000311_1 : 11:27:11:894: Yeah right right . 1
11:33:000312:000312_2 : 11:27:20:038: Play take me to the John I'm not showing the case without drop out and maybe I can look after the dog we can lick her I had to go to begin may be run without dropping . 2
