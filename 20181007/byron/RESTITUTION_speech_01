10:46:000096:000096_0 : 10:45:53:414: Okay, that's it for the development environment. Let's see how we take that to the production environment
10:46:000098:000098_2 : 10:45:59:879: So to deploy this will have to run webpack once and not as a dev server anymore anymore we just need to be able to 30/:/ . 2

10:48:000110:000110_2 : 10:48:13:841: And the same thing can be said from Django we could reuse off at an application with any different than any other application that went to the same time . 2
10:49:000111:000111_3 : 10:48:24:954: So that's it for production . 3

10:49:000114:000114_0 : 10:49:04:303: Generating API clients in the front end from documentation in Django in Django may be handling multiple frontends from the same backend, etc. I'm going to be talking now about now is asynchronous form validation. 2
10:49:000115:000115_3 : 10:49:20:415: So as you type C new era is coming directly from the Sun from the definition . 3
10:49:000116:000116_4 : 10:49:28:539: So let's look at the examples . 4
10:50:000117:000117_1 : 10:49:32:674: I don't know if you can read it again Sam United sign on and you come out at home where you choose a number of critics you want to enter the price of to make . 1

10:50:000119:000119_3 : 10:49:48:913: So the thing is, what kind of validation can you have in the front endll me something different and only has access to the data that's in the front and of course . 3
10:50:000120:000120_4 : 10:50:01:025: Who can check for a whether the fields are empty that they are and they are there is a value in there and whether those that you make sense on its own Friday please let me get if they were trying to . 4
10:50:000121:000121_1 : 10:50:15:156: But that's it, so the front and can only check for . 1
10:50:000122:000122_2 : 10:50:21:274: Consistency of the day Tate has available right now . 2
10:51:000123:000123_3 : 10:50:25:237: The backend however can do more because it can has access to all of the pre-existing data than that of a JD in the database example so we can do stuff like checking whether we As Americans we have enough items to satisfy disorder has more than 22 items stuck . 3
10:51:000124:000124_4 : 10:50:45:346: Error message we can also check whether the current user has enough credit to pay for this order . 4
10:51:000125:000125_1 : 10:50:52:463: The back-end on top of the self consistency of the date I can check whether it makes sense and it matches the pre-existing data . 1
10:51:000126:000126_2 : 10:51:04:392: So of course backend validation errors are much more interesting than front validation errors so the question that arises series can we use jingle bells in the front end as the user tight as I am telling . 2
10:51:000127:000127_3 : 10:51:20:515: What you for using this is something by Django rest framework . 3

10:53:000141:000141_1 : 10:52:45:608: If with if we're building with the dinner reviews from Generation login change the chances are there was you something like the create API view from django which as its name suggests when there's no error in the data that sense of how it's going to save a new entry in the database and so if you are using this for validation even if the user is the middle of taking something in there's no error. 1
10:53:000142:000142_2 : 10:53:11:721: wE'RE . 2
