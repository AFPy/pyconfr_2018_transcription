Metric-learn: a scikit-learn compatible package for metric learning William de Vazelhes


10:09:000014:000014_0 : 10:08:25:236: Just for you to know the version 0. . 1
10:09:000015:000015_2 : 10:08:33:842: It was really is just a few days ago . 2
10:09:000016:000016_3 : 10:08:37:511: Let's take a look at a simple example to understand better so let's say we want to recognise faces we have a bunch of faces from our friends and when a new picture of comes we want our machine learning system to classify the new image . 3
10:09:000017:000017_4 : 10:08:59:618: So here I will under our applications or the system to say oh this this one is Cooper . 4
10:09:000018:000018_1 : 10:09:08:206: Go to do it with her kitten but you will have to load the data set so hopefully ill take it on this the pictures I showed you our previous so you can just load them . 1
10:09:000019:000019_2 : 10:09:20:765: Putting out the the dataset . 2
10:09:000020:000020_0 : 10:09:24:355:
10:10:000021:000021_1 : 10:09:39:321: 400 images of 64 by 64 pixels in a grayscale in grayscale . 1
10:10:000022:000022_2 : 10:09:48:102: I thought you I just downloaded some random names on the internet to so that it's easier to understand what order labels so and I will collect the data and why the target the name of the people who want to classify ok so and here we will print them and we see that x is in fact a 2D array was the first dimension has 400 components . 2
10:10:000023:000023_3 : 10:10:19:243: Show . 3
10:11:000024:000024_4 : 10:10:21:382: 493 and under under call Adam Cullen Bella 4096 columns which are which each represent one pixel, so because there are 64 N64 felt so what you just flat flatten array of a piece of ok and it's time is is 1/:/ and then the way or the name of the person . 4
10:11:000025:000025_1 : 10:10:48:528: So remember the days chords to classify a new upcoming picture so what you will do as you will train split your data between train and test so that you can train a mother on some training data and you just keep aside as I said that would represent the new upcoming day diet that you have never seen before and you want that you want to move to classify . 1
10:11:000026:000026_2 : 10:11:14:160: Ok so here we see that the train set has 300 examples and test set 100 examples . 2
10:11:000027:000027_3 : 10:11:23:767: What you will do then is to train the classifier so here are represented the point . 3
10:11:000028:000028_4 : 10:11:30:900: in 2D space so that you can visualise it but you have to imagine that they can be like her head a little space so here it would be a 4096 dimensional space . 4
10:12:000029:000029_1 : 10:11:46:052: The Register corporation but we could have learnt any other model . 1
10:12:000030:000030_3 : 10:11:51:206: For the motherland what's really cool it was a concern is that they are PhD API of every mother is a shame to just have to say can be interchanged as you want you can send you the mother as you want ok so here are the registered address and we try to separate the different points so here are the same as represented on so I Separating the indus pays the difference of faces . 3
10:13:000031:000031_4 : 10:12:25:582: When did you can buy the new sample comes ok you were you just you already have the have on the front you so you say ok as is somebody is in the top or front you so I will say OK it's probably Mark because proper and we take it you're in . 4
10:13:000032:000032_1 : 10:12:47:708: You can now you can do the predict function but here if we predict every picture that is in the test that we see that there was a break then that's right now we don't really know if this is . 1
10:13:000033:000033_2 : 10:13:02:847: The good ones at the good names are not so what you can do to evaluate some of that is to use a function score by default for classifiit will use the accuracy so it will just count the the percentage of correctly classify the images so here we have correctly classified 91/:/ of the incoming images . 2
10:13:000034:000034_0 : 10:13:03:847: Cation
10:13:000035:000035_3 : 10:13:24:995: But then . 3
10:14:000036:000036_4 : 10:13:28:139: Speakers under a good default parameters but in fact you have to put some sometimes some parameters into the tomatoes and how to find the right value so then we do it in fact you will try them and score and see and just take this image that has the best car that's what you have to keep in mind is you cannot use the test set to score a when you do that because the disk that is something you . 4
10:14:000037:000037_1 : 10:13:56:279: From Ann you cannot train on it and selecting hyperparameters is a kind of training because you would like a choice based on some data so that's why you have to create a validation set from your train sets so you will have a train bis train set and variation set . 1
10:14:000038:000038_2 : 10:14:17:696: And then 42 to make sure you will sit on the train set and score on the evaluation set and you will see that we would like to to choose the second city fire with CK One . 2
10:15:000039:000039_3 : 10:14:33:472: In fact in practice you don't do that you you would use the circuit Rhona Brut search cross validation function . 3
10:15:000040:000040_4 : 10:14:42:626: Which makes it very easy to test a whole bunch of different parameters and I felt like this you you would just create a grid of different values for each for each hyperparameters is very that you want to test and then you instantiate a gridsearch to a subject and you can fit it and then it's like it's a matter is tomato so it's like an issue but it will have a lot of attribute that . 4
10:15:000041:000041_1 : 10:15:10:770: Which makes it very easy to test a whole bunch of different parameters and I felt like this you you would just create a grid of different values for each for each hyperparameters is very that you want to test and then you instantiate agree to a subject and you can fit it and then it's like it's a matter is tomato so it's like an issue but it will Percy after like your what are the best parameters that I have found the best score at cetera so use instead of time it will be tested because it's every combination of hyperparameters and we see that the best one is to take c = 5n . 1
10:15:000042:000042_2 : 10:15:33:000: Affinity L25 send . 2
10:16:000043:000043_3 : 10:15:38:166: Is that the metre was 96/:/ accuracy and in fact it does it doesn't do really is the train and validation split as I said before he does a lot of them . 3
10:16:000044:000044_4 : 10:15:51:289: Different different evaluation said and different train set in for serial correlation and it allowed to have better estimate for the score of these images . 4
10:16:000045:000045_1 : 10:16:05:414: Alright so . 1
10:16:000046:000046_2 : 10:16:09:559: Things into Euro to stop me but now that you have seen how to use a kitchen to do machine learning . 2
10:16:000047:000047_3 : 10:16:20:701: Running water ugly than that Tour de France it's a field of machine learning but we will see that they don't take the same input sometimes . 3
10:16:000048:000048_4 : 10:16:33:684: They can I need a switching examples . 4
10:17:000049:000049_2 : 10:16:43:950: So you have a few pictures of each person in the organisation in the building . 2
10:17:000050:000050_3 : 10:16:51:407: In what you also have is a huge data set of unlabeled images because so . 3
10:17:000051:000051_4 : 10:17:00:560: Tuesday to set of anybody message that says your phone on the internet something like this . 4
10:17:000052:000052_1 : 10:17:08:688: And yet do you keep this in the database and the thing is you will ask mechanical Turks to labour not images but pair of images as is it the same person or are there different person and why do you do that because in practice you cannot you cannot ask mechanical Turk so there is 0 people that are paid to do like their basic that you cannot ask you as someone with a picture of the . 1
10:17:000053:000053_2 : 10:17:41:813: Because . 2
10:18:000054:000054_3 : 10:17:44:692: Jacob I don't know if I see a random people I would not be able to find his name this . 3
10:18:000055:000055_4 : 10:17:52:792: Ok and we will see how we can use this information to infection exorcist M12 to do so . 4
10:18:000056:000056_1 : 10:18:03:844: We will in fact tried to do is to learn a metric between different faces different images of faces . 1
10:19:000057:000057_2 : 10:18:13:229: Put bank that are similar close together so images that are similar close together and by similar I mean they represent the same person and that will put images of people that are different person far away from each other so with a large distance . 2
10:19:000058:000058_0 : 10:18:32:616: And that is why you use metric learning that's what metric unit. In fact and not returning is able in this case to use the information about those that have been labelled as similar or dissimilar in order to learn this metric ok, if it is not clear y . 3
10:19:000059:000059_4 : 10:18:58:754: And ok so we had a look at an example but then once you have learnt the metric like this don't lots of stuff you can do after work . 4
10:19:000060:000060_1 : 10:19:14:900: Ok so . 1
10:19:000061:000061_2 : 10:19:18:043: You can you can recommend similar images you can the group pictures together by so yeah you can group pictures of the same person together which allows you front sensor to unlock a phone because with your face ID system for instance you can compare your new of coming face to Bench of faces that you have taken when you buy your phone for instance ok you can you can also . 2
10:19:000062:000062_3 : 10:19:49:178: Do . 3
10:19:000063:000063_4 : 10:19:51:320: Returning a for . 4
10:20:000064:000064_1 : 10:19:54:472: How to retrieve old friend stands . 1
10:20:000065:000065_2 : 10:19:57:608: To find a jurisdiction document that is similar to another one in a huge database then you can use metre turning . 2
10:20:000066:000066_3 : 10:20:10:434: Let's go out come back to our example and see how . 3
10:21:000067:000067_4 : 10:20:16:586: How is the data because right we want to do it in Python and we want to know how is the data so we in fact this dataset is already existing is Jackie Chan so you can just load it if the label face in the wild they just said so here I represented won the first here is 07 the first appear that you have in the dataset use either or two images of the same guy and the level . 4
10:21:000068:000068_1 : 10:20:51:732: Ok here is not a stranger thing as a percentage is 1 ok and you have like this a lot of Perth . 1
10:21:000069:000069_2 : 10:21:00:869: What is the drink the dataset with train on . 2
10:21:000070:000070_3 : 10:21:06:112: If you print it like in the array like you see that now the X is a 3D array so that is very important to understand it's not anymore a 2D array with n samples and and and features Collins is a 3D array with n samples line then the 2nd Dimension is too because they are pears and the third dimension is and features components . 3
10:21:000071:000071_4 : 10:21:38:859: And the labelled or 1 and -1 to -24 decimal place . 4
10:22:000072:000072_1 : 10:21:48:801: 24-hour when we were using secretary we have to split the data said between train and test set . 1
10:22:000073:000073_2 : 10:21:56:626: Gender in fact we can use your second and function pointer speed in this case because 20 split only looks at the third dimension it was just say ok I will slice that the input long before there mention so here it would work it will return to this disk array . 2
10:22:000074:000074_3 : 10:22:17:771: So . 3
10:22:000075:000075_4 : 10:22:20:910: Now the question is how do you learn from the data and I will show you . 4
10:22:000076:000076_1 : 10:22:31:047: Cauliflower concrete that grows on which does it which is a man will be symmetric for clustering . 1
10:23:000077:000077_2 : 10:22:38:076: My name is Matrix Focus steering wheel on a transformation matrix that will transform the input samples so in this case images like a vector . 2
10:23:000078:000078_3 : 10:22:53:210: If I didn't see it I didn't say it but they are . 3
10:23:000079:000079_4 : 10:22:57:963: I don't remember exactly they mentioned that it also to flatten vector image so it will transform this Victor . 4
10:23:000080:000080_1 : 10:23:12:099: Catalina transformation so how do you do it in . 1
10:23:000081:000081_2 : 10:23:18:235: Should just take the transformation metric Matrix and X the components the Victor . 2
10:24:000082:000082_3 : 10:23:27:520: And ok but what what is this new space what is what are these new new pictures you want them to be . 3
10:24:000083:000083_4 : 10:23:39:665: To define a matrix that is good for your task so here the the Matrix associated is simply that you clear understanding the new space so it's the norm of the difference of the transformations transformation and what's the what's the problem you will self is you will minimise the sum of the distances in the new space between points that for that have been labelled by the mechanical Turk I . 4
10:25:000084:000084_2 : 10:24:15:019: You will ensure that the distance between the points that have been able and dissimilar in the new space is sicario 2 certain value and this will allow because if you only have the the term for minimising the distances then you would have . 2
10:25:000085:000085_0 : 10:24:38:172: And now you will have minimise the distance between every point and including the point that are similar to what you want to do not to have that is and also to to put apart from that are far away from each other so that's why there's a certain time you have to ensure that the sum of difference the sum of distances between different
10:25:000086:000086_4 : 10:25:04:351: And then as I said that in the application of metric learning slide you can do lots of stuff can do can you receive a classification with metric you can do clustering so that's also an important point because often when you do clustering you . 4
10:26:000087:000087_1 : 10:25:23:479: You don't really know you don't give out information because it's an unsafe like most of times you say something to provide techniques so I just have my did I want to close the right in two months of points and the thing is often it doesn't matter as you want princess in like it if I didn't put information it could have custard point . 1
10:26:000088:000088_2 : 10:25:47:616: The same of face orientation together for instance and that's not what I want so this network training allows you to give us some information that can be used for Crystal . 2
10:26:000089:000089_4 : 10:26:00:790: Ok so if anything is unclear for an hour then asked me . 4
10:26:000090:000090_1 : 10:26:09:562: Now we will see how to use the metric ton packet . 1
10:26:000091:000091_2 : 10:26:14:708: So how to loads of data in Python and what is a concrete example of an algorithm but we don't know how we use the metric ton cricket . 2
10:26:000092:000092_3 : 10:26:26:107: So . 3
10:26:000093:000093_4 : 10:26:30:255: The Beckett equals greater Dubai city career and 1 x 470 2009 exams some . 4
10:27:000094:000094_1 : 10:26:41:402: Santander Renault Dauphine 13 contributors . 1
10:27:000095:000095_0 : 10:26:46:532: So here it all the contributors on the tablet you can see my line edition. Of course there are also other contributors with discussions and issues etc . 2
10:27:000096:000096_3 : 10:27:00:658: So . 3
10:27:000097:000097_4 : 10:27:05:784: Jean de Luz version 0.4 Giroud vs Frieza 1 months ago but is not yet compatible with scikit-learn and in the rest of the talk I will explain to you how to make it compatible with scikit-learn and how will we be able in percentage of the 5:2 train station to 23° search . 1
10:27:000098:000098_2 : 10:27:36:106: Yeah there's a change . 2
10:28:000099:000099_3 : 10:27:39:607: Remember the day that we had after speaking with like this represented by a 3D arrays . 3
10:28:000100:000100_4 : 10:27:48:753: So in fact . 4
10:28:000101:000101_1 : 0250 disco Matt will be accepted because the format is very simple very simple to understand and . 1
10:28:000102:000102_2 : 10:28:03:807: Out of the box you you will be able to instantiate an MCMC algorithm . 2
10:28:000103:000103_3 : 10:28:12:934: An agreed for some hyperparameter and . 3
10:29:000104:000104_4 : 10:28:18:066: Create a grid search CV objects like in scikit-learn and fit the greatest so why don't you talk is because in fact cos I relation with jeans and research the only look at the forms I mention they will they win only they will only sleep on the floor dimensions of this please or Siri only like they are still valid input data is it so I mean is the right lighting so this will . 4
10:29:000105:000105_1 : 10:28:49:188: In internet version but this is a problem is that in metric learning you have these datasets and . 1
10:29:000106:000106_2 : 10:29:00:335: You're so before I will show you that your friend sent this this point is replicated 2 times because it is involved into bed and in practice points can be involved in a lot of person sounds of frozen when they're high dimensional points like images . 2
10:29:000107:000107_3 : 10:29:19:474: Makes a representation . 3
10:29:000109:000109_4 : 10:29:22:618: This makes a representation of the data that is very very busy indeed it can blow up your memory ok so there was there will be also another way to give the data to matrix rotten tomatoes in the next version by two ways of in this is so as represented here instead of having a 3D array of release of Vector . 4
10:30:000110:000110_1 : 10:29:49:759: You just have . 1
10:30:000111:000111_3 : 10:29:51:897: Indices and then of course you have to give on the other side to the estimated that are set in which she want to speak to pick the sample space on the Indesit so he you just give this to the tomato and the data set is given that the Beginning at initialisation but then when you fit on the train set Theatre Matilda say ok So I will go to take them for a crazy Bear its similarity and it will it rain next . 3
10:30:000112:000112_4 : 10:30:31:965: And the only thing that end here is that you will . 4
10:31:000113:000113_1 : 10:30:37:105: Two things that end first the Witcher putting that in feet is not anymore just does it's the person in this is and you have to be in at the beginning . 1
10:31:000114:000114_2 : 10:30:49:233: The data into the process of orgrimmar . 2
10:31:000115:000115_4 : 10:30:54:417: That's you looked on you be able to do it with indices you can also you will also be able to do it with any kind of object that is an indicator of the data so here we can have trains to represent so . 4
10:31:000116:000116_1 : 10:31:18:519: Instead of indices so here it still very low memory consumption just just a dream and in this case instead of putting the data into the processor you will put a callable . 1
10:31:000117:000117_2 : 10:31:35:665: Go to the tickets on input data identifiers and go to fetch . 2
10:31:000118:000118_3 : 10:31:43:801: The data so what the colour Bournemouth return is a 3D array as we said before . 3
10:32:000119:000119_4 : 10:31:52:452: And in fact . 4
10:32:000120:000120_1 : 10:31:55:380: In fact . 1
10:32:000121:000121_2 : 10:31:57:506: How to reduce the memory consumption but it is still a point that I didn't say to you is that if you do this and inside the algorithm in pseudocode then someone goes to fit the whole 3D array then it will be the same problem as before it was create bigger Reddit who brought the memory so in fact what are grieving will do is to fit indices or batch birthday . 2
10:33:000122:000122_3 : 10:32:27:652: The best so . 3
10:33:000123:000123_4 : 10:32:30:794: The the Twitter the first 10 examples of pain in the centre of indices and the processor will form a 2D array that have 10 lines and it would be used to update some computation for instance if you want to come to the gradient it will be used to date it's ok now or I will just give you a quick overview of the package so . 4
10:33:000124:000124_1 : 10:33:06:933: You'll have to read all this is just to tell you that there are . 1
10:33:000125:000125_2 : 10:33:13:075: At the bottom you can see that they are really don't . 2
10:33:000126:000126_3 : 10:33:19:205: And I will go into more details you will understand better here so . 3
10:34:000127:000127_4 : 10:33:26:350: Whether they are all different types of erosions for matrix running we only saw a man and his metric for clustering in the case where you have labelled them but there are also other stuff so first they are some free supervise metric learning algorithms that work as the regular so here for them as reggae or transformers from Jackie Chan like never company night night . 4
10:34:000128:000128_1 : 10:33:52:499: Nearest neighbourhood and FDA . 1
10:34:000129:000129_2 : 10:33:57:620: The Moor Road dire . 2
10:34:000130:000130_3 : 10:34:00:768: Acid metabolism but it's still your throat and . 3
10:34:000131:000131_4 : 10:34:08:915: This will take as before input point like eggs and two data that is labelled with the fact that and then make sure that they will learn is a metric that Boots close our eyes that have the same class and put far away from each other voices have a Different Class . 4
10:34:000132:000132_1 : 10:34:30:038: There is also in a supervised by Shawn mak kms reclining for kernel regression so this I go with him will . 1
10:35:000133:000133_2 : 10:34:40:175: Would do together that have the same target values are in reverse and the why is a continuous value points them so they will be closer together that have the same value . 2
10:35:000135:000135_3 : 10:34:53:543: And that can be useful for instance if you use the Channel panel regression . 3
10:35:000136:000136_4 : 10:35:03:691: Turn . 4
10:35:000137:000137_1 : 10:35:05:823: It's a bit like a k nearest neighbours but for Recreation can improve the performance there but ok so they are also the weakly supervised algorithms and these are the ones that are kind of original and we specific to metric learning . 1
10:36:000138:000138_2 : 10:35:26:892: Tour de Paris agreement that like the one I presented you my little piece metric for customer there's also a Tunisian man but that you can also run on quadruplets instead of Paris and . 2
10:36:000139:000139_3 : 10:35:44:027: You are so how does it work but you talk to remember that every weakly supervised when is a weakly supervised as it's because they don't work on the X and Y is there they don't know now on Peugeot could you please find us so every week is supervisor gruesome comes with a supervisor version that is kind of rapper that will underfloor maze on the X and Y . 3
10:37:000140:000140_4 : 10:36:13:164: Paris hotels are of similar samples and dose of this email sample or they can even create quadruplets as extender after a bit if you if you really want to use it and then see that you are labelled data which is cool because there was more information you can see you this because there's a supervisor . 4
10:37:000141:000141_1 : 10:36:37:296: So yeah just a quick point about how to learn with granny flat so instead of saying ok these two samples are similar or these two samples old is Mila you can say instead some play is most similar to sample b then C is to D so it's a different kind of supervision is weaker because you don't force you don't force her distance between samples to be smaller or bigger you just say it . 1
10:37:000142:000142_2 : 10:37:06:432: So yeah just a quick point about how to learn with granny flat so instead of saying ok these two samples are similar or these two samples old is Mila you can say instead some play is most similar to sample b then C is to D so it's a different kind of supervision is weaker because you don't force you don't force her distance between samples to be Bigger than another distance and . 2
10:37:000143:000143_4 : 10:37:14:820: First Java dataset then you can use it but even you can also cast different problems this way and so to see if you have different results in . 4
10:37:000144:000144_1 : 10:37:29:945: So . 1
10:37:000145:000145_2 : 10:37:34:098: Here is a diagram of the weakly supervised owners . 2
10:38:000146:000146_3 : 10:37:42:260: How do I said that every which is supervised algorithm has a supervisor some Debussy know it from the base of neck base class . 3
10:38:000147:000147_4 : 10:37:54:894: Call it weakly supervised methadone Aires from the . 4
10:38:000148:000148_1 : 10:38:00:361: LEGO a meeting for parents are missing for a Peugeot play specifiers which an internal it from a base class from Ipswich sonar . 1
10:38:000149:000149_2 : 10:38:14:098: Dorinda Slade you see there is a pretty centre score France and authority finder at the . 2
10:38:000150:000150_3 : 10:38:21:185: Neville from their alloys only could they would be the most you can do everything with notes of times it will be the same way you would score every person see fire . 3
10:38:000151:000151_4 : 10:38:32:326: So . 4
10:38:000152:000152_1 : 10:38:35:472: How do you score in the context of mental Theo . 1
10:38:000153:000153_2 : 10:38:41:607: The first . 2
10:39:000154:000154_3 : 10:38:43:747: It's not . 3
10:39:000155:000155_4 : 10:38:45:871: Does every metric learner has to have scopus method because this is the basic stuff you can do with message running is you take two instances and it had to run the metric so it has to give you a metric so similarity or distance between the two points so this is the Scorpions function . 4
10:39:000156:000156_1 : 10:39:09:009: But as I know you would use the suspension scorers to to do a credit so it uses of threshold for instance you can see you would be able to fix a threshold and say if my car is my similarity score between two samples is very high these are very close together so I would predict one because ok there are similar samples and if it's not then I will predict - 1 and like this week . 1
10:40:000157:000157_2 : 10:39:44:155: You can benefit from all sites doing fencing that work on classification for instance like the accuracy or are you see . 2
10:40:000158:000158_3 : 10:39:56:299: What's a be able to use Deezer the functions because . 3
10:40:000159:000159_4 : 10:40:02:438: The score France and is implemented and it just come . 4
10:40:000160:000160_2 : 10:40:17:001: Ok yeah where when you can do predictions you you can do accurate is going in and for credit . 2
10:41:000161:000161_3 : 10:40:28:425: The score in the prediction is done this way you would say one if a so you will have input data which are instead of personal credit so the 2nd Dimension of the 3G a reference and will be for and if they are right they arrive in the right order ring meaning of the first one is most similar to the second one than the surrenders to the first one then as you would predict my . 3
10:41:000162:000162_4 : 10:40:56:587: It's not . 4
10:41:000163:000163_1 : 10:40:58:716: If its natural predict - 1 and if it is you would predict what . 1
10:41:000164:000164_2 : 10:41:04:860: And also as you can the credit plus 100 minus one you can do anything from from section functions to to do all types of scoring . 2
10:41:000165:000165_3 : 10:41:18:122: Matrix learning algorithms right now in the package or nylon obese London . 3
10:42:000166:000166_4 : 10:41:30:238: I will explain what it is but that's why there is a missing for that so funny thing is really cool . 4
10:42:000167:000167_1 : 10:41:41:373: That there is a multiple inheritance or in fact you can create mixing that kind of represents a mathematical properties of estimators and health 3 each we have to organise a different estimators and create new ones that inherit from properties of others etc . 1
10:42:000168:000168_2 : 10:42:01:509: Laura marlin Ibiza . 2
10:42:000169:000169_3 : 10:42:04:653: Show me the one that learns a linear transformation of the input space so as a friend with MMC . 3
10:42:000170:000170_4 : 10:42:15:810: Ok so this means that they all have a transform function I didn't explain it when I was speaking about sex on but . 4
10:42:000171:000171_1 : 10:42:25:617: There is the Transformers Transformers I got him that . 1
10:42:000172:000172_2 : 10:42:31:770: Are able to transform points into a number in space and this is what sold all metric learning advisor me know which one would be able to do it and they will also be able to do an insanity reductions so . 2
10:43:000173:000173_0 : 10:42:50:911: Going to details about this. . 3
10:43:000174:000174_4 : 10:42:54:544: Will be possible . 4
10:43:000175:000175_1 : 10:42:57:485: No I will just . 1
10:43:000176:000176_2 : 10:43:03:607: Look a little bit about testing in the context of metric long but I think it's a place to machine learning or even numerical scientific computing in Python and . 2
10:43:000177:000177_3 : 10:43:19:756: I like this topic so . 3
10:43:000178:000178_4 : 10:43:19:756: Alan when you test for instance metre training advisor or machining erosion is the . 4
10:44:000179:000179_1 : 10:43:29:059: You don't know in advance what you want to test . 1
10:44:000180:000180_2 : 10:43:33:206: When you want to test summer grazing that will totally you can give off a cliff that I can do example of a list and you know in the event that the least has to be ordered in this way you can see you can specify it and that if it's true or false India but in machine learning you can have a grazing that have several options and don't ok like their own political solution and you don't know in advance so what . 2
10:44:000181:000181_3 : 10:44:07:347: The the meaning it will going to . 3
10:45:000182:000182_4 : 10:44:14:489: Or tomorrow at 13 so that hopefully what you can do is to test some properties of the results that you expect so here are some examples for instance with something that is really useful is when you want to implement a new algorithm that has the computer gradient you can check that the gradient is correct basing its phenotype Reclamation . 4
10:45:000183:000183_1 : 10:44:47:628: Another way of kind of Computing the gradient which is approximate and this is a pre built in sci-fi sci-fi debris so it is really useful for another example is that if you want to say that the transformation is injured in your eyes that you would start with something samples that are linear combination of . 1
10:45:000184:000184_0 : 10:45:10:534: Example starting at
10:46:000185:000185_3 : 10:45:16:680: The end they verified dinner or equity ok so you can use three examples and I will go on details about this example simple examples that exhibit a property that you can test and here is an example for My Little Piece metric for clustering MMC . 3
10:46:000186:000186_4 : 10:45:39:840: You can put 3 points in a space and you say ok I want to label these two points as ring Lisa Miller and disappointed been similar but at the starting point there are there they don't respect this because this is his distance here is smaller than this distance . 4
10:46:000187:000187_1 : 10:45:59:980: I said she's a toy example because you know in advance that there exist A linear transformation that will be able to put the two points too as well and these two points further . 1
10:46:000188:000188_2 : 10:46:12:233: Because you can just rescale axis is an email confirmation of the space and it will give you the reason she wants . 2
10:46:000189:000189_3 : 10:46:21:367: Here is how you did say to you and one thing is that is important is that in the end you will not test card values of . 3
10:47:000190:000190_4 : 10:46:31:523: The coordinates of the Punch with just a test the ranking of the senses so of course is more difficult to really test but because of you there are lots of stuff that you you don't test here but still doing a lot of time examples like this you can prevent a lot of mistakes it's a lot of it so as a quick recap of . 4
10:47:000191:000191_5 : 10:46:57:670: What will happen in new in version 0.5 0 is that you will be able to be compatible with Jackie Chan . 1
10:47:000192:000192_2 : 10:47:06:815: The research etc and do it in memory efficient way with the process arrival . 2
10:47:000193:000193_3 : 10:47:14:962: Our to submit to 13 contributor and country is an organisation on the top that holds lots of second-hand compatible packages and so there are some requirements of quality of course compatibility with set kitchen to a lot of tests that has to pass . 3
10:47:000194:000194_4 : 10:47:38:101: Like special as a secretary of death . 4
10:48:000195:000195_1 : 10:47:42:267: Ok so little that would give some more of this ability to the project and . 1
10:48:000196:000196_2 : 10:47:50:106: So also other stuff on the next step tour still get sick of tomatoes or tomatos so right now a lot of his own use cypher algorithms for optimising princess mattresses princess parameters that you want to run so that they use for the ultimate computer full radiance on all the samples so I sent if you know about the super secret Santa sent is it Sunnah gradon that only . 2
10:49:000197:000197_3 : 10:48:27:254: Only works on batteries of samples and does one iteration by comes to go grey dun dun some samples and sunbed shop sample and then do it like so if you are allowed to be more scalable also because it is not only is doesn't blow the memory but it also can convert faster because they were the purpose of our stuff that prevents for rowing the memory but still I could take a long time to . 3
10:49:000198:000198_4 : 10:48:57:409: Resample to computer greyhounds and Jen just wanted to Russian etc so this will also allowed to be quicker . 4
10:49:000199:000199_1 : 10:49:05:543: Then I would like to give more choices to form pairs or counterfeit or forgery place from label data so right now it's very nice we just see some enable data and we just say ok we want to form all the possible pairs so if you have a 5 images from the oneplus you will create £25 and then you can select to just keep a few samples but maybe we can do more intelligent by . 1
10:49:000200:000200_2 : 10:49:36:688: Only creating build that sell have a useful information ok . 2
10:50:000201:000201_3 : 10:49:43:848: Who had emotional functions like regularizer this thing of course is that can never be too much to sing in the communication a lot more documentation . 3
10:50:000202:000202_4 : 10:49:55:990: African is a very neat returning is an original away and origin of subset of machinery which is very useful when you want to run similarities and when you have can be useful when you have a weekly to provide information there are many use cases about it does the Metrocentre kids to do it which is open source and in the next version there will be sectioned compatibility . 4
10:51:000203:000203_0 : 10:50:26:133: African is a very neat returning is an original away and origin of subset of machinery which is very useful when you want to run similarities and when you have can be useful when you have a weekly to provide information there are many use cases about it does the Metrocentre kids to do it which is open source and in Yeah you can check it out it's our first or second raise issues submitted. Discuss on guitar and any contribution is very welcome . 1
10:51:000204:000204_2 : 10:50:38:355: That's it for me thank you very much for attention and you have any questions . 2
10:51:000205:000205_3 : 10:50:45:496: Ok . 3
10:51:000206:000206_4 : 10:51:01:000: Yeah . 4
10:51:000207:000207_1 : 10:51:05:148: Yes so ok so the question was that you have a problem or you use one particular emitter sending a dozen NCA and . 1
10:51:000208:000208_2 : 10:51:39:302: Ok . 2
10:52:000209:000209_3 : 10:51:44:442: Ok so in a very large database of documents are more than Southend and you want to . 3
10:52:000210:000210_4 : 10:51:53:593: Parallelizable . 4
10:52:000211:000211_1 : 10:51:54:593: That's a good question and NCA been working on any at the beginning of my contract so . 1
10:52:000212:000212_3 : 10:52:10:046: Who is use numpy applications that and then B and ensure that it is a Oreo competition to vectorise so that there was a parallelism for likes to be really fast so that the first thing . 3
10:52:000213:000213_4 : 10:52:25:185: If you know I can run it on images of maybe not use database but I still really really faster than that what was at the beginning metric ton Francis . 4
10:53:000214:000214_1 : 10:52:39:331: The use of an Empire because it's under the authority . 1
10:53:000215:000215_2 : 10:52:46:466: God will use older cars to do matrix multiplication but then now you talk about so I think that there will also be the problem of memory may be . 2
10:53:000216:000216_3 : 10:52:59:605: So maybe the process of John would be something that you could use to avoid the two forms a to having memory old are the similarities of the Pearl Princess . 3
10:53:000217:000217_4 : 10:53:17:746: Yeah . 4
10:54:000218:000218_1 : 10:53:21:901: Two different letters etc . 1
10:54:000219:000219_2 : 10:53:27:038: Width width Excel for instance there is but people record me if I'm wrong with you can use for instance different backend that like dark or I like that which is another library that Rose to do parallel processing there is a friend that's gay marriage records x-rays and allowed to do machine running on different letters and . 2
10:54:000220:000220_3 : 10:53:57:185: Sore and the requirement that later on maybe . 3
10:54:000221:000221_4 : 10:54:02:316: Maybe better enjoy them is quite simple so it could be easy quote in that may be so . 4
10:55:000222:000222_1 : 10:54:12:452: Yeah . 1
10:55:000223:000223_2 : 10:54:30:503: Yep . 2
10:55:000224:000224_4 : 10:54:34:501: So that's a good question so ok the question was how does it compare for instance for the coming similarities 2 comments retrieval how does it compare how does metric learning compared to other techniques that are like I guess you are talking about embedding techniques that will ever and documents in some space yeah . 4
10:56:000225:000225_1 : 10:55:26:811: So . 1
10:56:000226:000226_2 : 10:55:28:973: So first they are you can do some basic . 2
10:56:000227:000227_3 : 10:55:28:973: With the machine running in deal with a TF idf etc but sometimes it would not give you some good reasons that's why some people use because the initial metric is not really good advice people will try sometimes to embed documents in space that is that is that has more information can be a supervisor or superviser like with different axis thickness etc but so and . 3
10:56:000228:000228_4 : 10:56:09:276: This would compare maybe to the supervised algorithm in metric ton that are ways to Amber's points are in a space space on some labelled information Francis mama Tree Chinese very very useful is when you don't have a label and you don't want to do and supervised learning because it will not give you what you want like and in this case when you have labels on the bath or a . 4
10:57:000229:000229_1 : 10:56:38:422: This would compare maybe to the supervised algorithm in metric ton that are ways to Amber's points are in a space space on some labelled information Francis mama Tree Chinese very very useful is when you don't have a label and you don't want to do and supervised learning because it will not give you what you want like and in this case when you have And this is stuff that is easier to ask to mechanical Turks . 1
11:03:000230:000230_2 : 10:56:45:663: You would like to use the metric metre training . 2
11:03:000231:000231_3 : 10:56:50:801: At element of the next song . 3

11:03:000232:000232_3 : 11:03:22:276: Thank you I am not able . 3
11:04:000233:000233_4 : 11:03:44:429: No thank . 4
11:04:000234:000234_1 : 11:03:50:329: Good morning everyone thank you all for coming to the stop I might you saying are from India and I'm currently majoring in computer science and engineering and will be graduating next to you so they stopped up and I'm like currently working on a research Lab golf club in New Delhi and lab is basically working on it on my speakers so and for the past few months happy . 1
11:04:000235:000235_2 : 11:04:17:483: Good morning everyone thank you all for coming to the stop I might you saying are from India and I'm currently majoring in computer science and engineering and will be graduating next to you so they stopped up and I'm like currently working on a research Lab golf club in New Delhi and lab is basically working on it on my speakers so and Loss of vision deep are busy planning which has been quite active . 2
11:05:000236:000236_0 : 11:04:25:722: D.va why is it so so . 3
11:05:000237:000237_4 : 11:04:31:869: Ok so to start with slight the current state of our machine learning and deep learning tech models is that we are not able to do you actually see these Morrison not actually able to tell us about the uncertainties and son been one of the main factors for these models that we actually want to know that what is more models don't don't understand and for the CIA . 4
11:05:000238:000238_1 : 11:05:04:005: Is up like a beauty an approach to the authors deep learning and the machine learning and Sophie is machine learning and deep learning applications are a cross with seals in Lakeside Vanguard healthcare and a long long with which country makes it easier with critical applications and so we have to be very certain about the you know about the predictions old is Zola Budd out for . 1
11:05:000239:000239_2 : 11:05:05:005: What is a giving and therefore we have to basically tell . 2
11:06:000240:000240_3 : 11:05:39:353: 14th chapter of these models . 3
11:06:000241:000241_4 : 11:05:43:504: Lexus was the news from biggest 2015/16 when this was the first fatal crash today slow card and some reason which of the car which for a photograph was that the car was not able to distinguish between the you play cowboy tractors and then the white Skype so look for these reasons of you know . 4
11:06:000242:000242_1 : 11:06:09:664: Beep like the things which lead to this kind of cases is very important . 1
11:06:000243:000243_2 : 11:06:17:795: What differences do like what is uncertainty and that's why it is important so uncertainty fiscal that's do you know the dictionary meaning of the same . 2
11:07:000244:000244_0 : 11:06:29:921: You're not 100/:/ sure. What are output is at the state of being under 18 . 3
11:07:000245:000245_0 : 11:06:37:420: And so in deep learning I will be with you talking about are two main types of uncertainties which the first one is a lot of the daily toric uncertainty and setting the second one is the second one is epistemic so in aleatory uncertainty be into metres. What we cannot understand from our data so things like garlic occlusion allocation stop using a lack of under over the . 4
11:07:000246:000246_0 : 11:07:06:548: Areas in our data so we need to understand these things so we can see in this example. . 1
11:07:000247:000247_2 : 11:07:13:675: Other kind of overlapping so we are sure you're not very sure these two cars with overlapping so we can do it we have to take these things into account and . 2
11:08:000248:000248_3 : 11:07:27:821: Open 13th is the epistemic which which tends to measure that what we are like the Nordic what cases are models not able to . 3
11:08:000249:000249_4 : 11:07:40:966: 02392 the main reason for the same could be allowed to have you know the training data for the same so this is very good example for somewhere we have these in Port images and so this is a image segmentation example of every pixel is classified into 13 classes and you can see that you're in this daily toric uncertainty over the borders of like these our letters and it . 4
11:09:000250:000250_0 : 11:08:10:093: The model is quite uncertain about the data because that's kind of click here we have in the book Fusions and stuff like that and then in epistemic uncertainty we can see that in this party food bad things like it's quite uncertain that whether it's a footpath because because this one is not rain for food. So it's quite certain about things like us or Europe reason stuff like that but . 1
11:09:000251:000251_2 : 11:08:11:093: Video on talking about the football tonight so this is what we are aiming to this is what we aim for using this application . 2
11:09:000252:000252_3 : 11:08:45:356: Love you so so basically know what we want is a suit know what we wanted something where we can have you nobody feels deep learning and then we can be sleeping the uncertainty thing and for the same what we have is a bayesian probability Theory which we will be using along with the Deep learning which which combines to make the bayesian Deep learning . 3
11:09:000253:000253_4 : 11:09:12:486: Ok and I . 4
11:10:000254:000254_1 : 11:09:16:165: Sort yourself before you move on to the vision things so let's try to just I see the basics of the conventional unit works soap sud neural networks are nothing but you're not a series of linear transformations which can be accomplished by Simple matrix multiplication so so here we have so the function f basically X X X X Factor with the Wi-Fi and then adds a 2 DB when we . 1
11:10:000255:000255_2 : 11:09:47:296: Oliver chicken Caesar disfigure like this gets multiplied to this then we add a device to it and then we get the intermediate output which will then throw the ball so like we have things like dinosaur daily which are simply like Activision Blizzard to bring the non-linearity in . 2
11:11:000256:000256_3 : 11:10:09:451: The one making me to think which we have here is that we tend to have with switch off . 3
11:11:000257:000257_4 : 11:10:10:451: Play The Wave salon which featured video of you know this would be very discreet so this would be very specific values of sorting values for a particular deep learning models but the main difference which comes in the bayesian neural network is not installed as a discrete of weights and biases we having to clean makeup you make or distribution nor did we try to learn . 4
11:11:000258:000258_8 : 11:10:46:775: Are these weights and biases to install with cleaning up like just 0.8 and 3.1 we will kind of be built into you no longer a distribution over these weights and biases so so make sure all these are weights and biases just turns into a distribution probability distribution . 1
11:12:000259:000259_2 : 11:11:09:922: Yes so now at the very heart of these are like the bayesian probability Theory is this is a classical piece still them witches like Robbie of a given B is the probability of B given into probability of a and then ÷ property of be so please don't say that mean Family part is that we tend to learn return to basically no surprises for the Portuguese and with Intent . 2
11:12:000260:000260_3 : 11:11:43:052: Do you know these two are fostered over to the final output which he was so the procedure is the big data distribution which we are trying to find and then we have a prior that can be any any distribution abortion or anything like that and the likelihood is the . 3
11:12:000261:000261_4 : 11:12:04:190: Mistley what's the likelihood that giving something for giving a what is likelihood that we are going to get beef and then this is evidence which is the probability of be so when we see this in terms of machine learning and deep learning models of what we have is the Galaxy 2 on DVD these are basically which we are trying to learn from a model and then this is the date . 4
11:13:000262:000262_1 : 11:12:31:342: Singing potato with a baby have . 1
11:13:000263:000263_0 : 11:12:36:488: Visiter little likelihood functions prior probabilities and then the posterior distribution which we are trying to find so innocuous so let me know when when we optimise are the only models that we have to optimise ticket are tomatoes on the way to make 3 to 39. . 2
11:13:000264:000264_3 : 11:12:59:619: That's what does the posterior distribution that we are like we're trying to find probability distribution over you know that was given the data and here we have the like the prior probability which we insulate suppose we take a question distribution without me touching me and we didn't talk all the weights and biases and . 3
11:13:000265:000265_4 : 11:13:24:777: Problem with this flex with the bass time in terms of . 4
11:14:000266:000266_1 : 11:13:30:925: That is the is this time maybe off the witches are evidence and it's just a constraint suno the problem is that this can also be written as we receive the return to find . 1
11:14:000267:000267_2 : 11:13:45:067: And other data or overwriting next in Port 8000 given what I was up late for all day look for all the parameters which we have this tends to be an interactable problem because you know they would be in final distributed some beach at the time we arrived so so this is one of the major problems which we know which we have to solve when we are using this when we are using . 2
11:14:000268:000268_3 : 11:14:12:187: M40 clear case . 3
11:14:000269:000269_0 : 11:14:16:318: What we are flights to solve this weekend to use an approximation techniques which which will kind of do sampling over the sporty clothes of you know in 48 hour and will try to give us an approximate value for this protocol constant and I will be free to SCART to Aldi's of places to visit between you and which I would be discussing in
11:15:000270:000270_0 : 11:14:47:440: Cancel this world drive from DVR cont.ws drive from the radiation in Sydney . 1
11:15:000271:000271_0 : 11:14:55:124: Swingarm send video to influence what we say is that ok so so we have to find out probability distribution like the probability distribution of weight given our data so we tend to take orders you may probability distribution with security. And I've basically our aim is to optimise like what it will be assumed to the final value which is the posterior distribution on for this . 2
11:16:000272:000272_3 : 11:15:23:253: Take the kill me trick with a scale divergence which tells us that you know how close are how far these distributions are so you can see that up to optimise our palomitas mean to minimise a sloth build a wooden floors football boot these distributions . 3
11:16:000273:000273_4 : 11:15:46:127: The problem with this was that are so this win between are modelled using the video shoes in French means to be a bit slow and also potentially bit slow so so later one of the techniques which was proposed I use in 2000 . 4
11:16:000274:000274_1 : 11:16:06:255: 2015 link June 2015 by Aaron carlito vs Monte Carlo Dropout techniques so what do you propose to go that are so they gave the protocol finding that we can use drop out which is a very famous . 1
11:16:000275:000275_2 : 11:16:24:388: 2015 link June 2015 by Aaron carlito vs Monte Carlo Dropout techniques so what do you propose to go that are so they gave the protocol finding that we can use You are in the deep learning models to basically or basically find deviations between France and . 2
11:17:000276:000276_3 : 11:16:35:567: Distributions over it and . 3
11:17:000277:000277_4 : 11:16:40:719: How to do like the idea behind this like why they were using Dropout by the way using drop out with let's just see that how they work Dropout looks like so ok so we use regularization techniques in business so that we don't like them being so that we don't all fit on a keto which means that we are . 4
11:18:000278:000278_1 : 11:17:10:863: Play George on delays over a data on 02 model shoot John Lewis over the data not simply you know Roseland Lake the input data which it has and for the same so like we had these are Leos with the Neurons and every new line is the interdependent on each other and so what we do is not simply random movie drop some of the neurone soma to select during our training face for you try to eat . 1
11:18:000279:000279_2 : 11:17:38:995: If we ignore her simply as you go out around instructions of the neurone from my body and then weekly train ticket money for the same and then during our testing fees or so doing this thing Tuesday morning good looks like same like it or it will have all the notes as we just have to accept it or with invoices with the liquid . 2
11:18:000280:000280_5 : 11:18:03:137: For example if we take like a fraction of 50/:/ so I need to be doing the training phase we will simply drop you know 50/:/ of neurone soma models and when we using our doing the testing phase when we when we will get define lodges are the new the final output we will just multiply all these with 0.5 just two Factor . 3
11:18:000281:000281_4 : 11:18:30:279: We have a new job some of the neurones are you during the training phase . 4
11:19:000282:000282_1 : 11:18:37:097: Yes or the main idea behind this like using Dropout four legs video videos free . 1
11:19:000283:000283_0 : 11:18:48:234: So are the daughters said. So suppose selective look at Dropout technique what we're doing is basically a new dawn it's a corner off . 2
11:20:000284:000284_3 : 11:19:01:386: Dr Peter switching on article on your own or we are turning it off so it's kind of a pine tree things like 0 or 1 and which can be seen which is very similar to the police . 3
11:20:000285:000285_4 : 11:19:33:512: Swing video snow in France we were basically as you mean a particular distribution which we were going to further optimised so that it gets close to the final distribution between want and to hear that distribution would ba banana ba banana distribution and . 4
11:20:000286:000286_1 : 11:19:56:650: Thought it would be so that they could be used to perform door video selling friends and serious decision which sea is between our case will be up on a lead to serious thought this was the kind of intuition . 1
11:20:000287:000287_2 : 11:20:13:803: Lake around which the LEGO people live around but it's quite an intense if not so that you can always look to this like this paper which so they have proved everything like why the property would tend to you don't give us the same results as a ratio in French . 2
11:21:000288:000288_3 : 11:20:37:328: So also find . 3
11:21:000289:000289_4 : 11:20:50:470: Let's just look at the sample code snippet for you for free meeting this month Alicante Dropout techniques so I have so the problem seems that we have a simple of you know we are using a simple model Elena's Models and which is a very basic one and we are applying this to the MOT status 8 which is Which is like a charge does hydrogen desert images around Lake 60000 m . 4
11:21:000290:000290_1 : 11:21:23:605: Ignore spin the wheel spin classes . 1
11:22:000291:000291_0 : 11:21:28:755: So simply are you going to see that this this is a basic architecture which has two countries then to fully connected layers and here can see that. We apply drop out to be Buddies with the property of with 20/:/ where are we dropping out 20/:/ of . 2
11:22:000292:000292_3 : 11:21:50:901: And finally like so this what is entitled to choose a deep learning framework for implementing this and so so here we simply sweet biscuit be a defining great dane for Poole departures we are so this is the Living put down the target disk optimisation then . 3
11:22:000293:000293_4 : 11:22:14:045: Play me train or optimise like it's very basic training step and finally finally in the testing things so what we have to do is that of when we test we basically take 10 samples Southend Echo variable amount of titration so suppose we take out food for 20 cases and then we will be refined what's the mean and the variance for that particular Alexa IV chloride racing . 4
11:23:000294:000294_1 : 11:22:45:190: I'd love to all of you can see that we take this article 102 103 since we will find the output which is the largest . 1
11:23:000295:000295_2 : 11:22:56:340: The mean and the variance which is given to the higher we didn't mean that the uncertainty is quite high and the Lotus which means that the world is quite confident for the same . 2
11:24:000296:000296_3 : 11:23:12:477: So these are the outputs so so this is like the 2 digit which is like these photos are very similar to the original video and Alfie deyes images with C that David in Staines to increase which state is that the uncertainty model is getting uncertain about whatever predictions it is it's making . 3
11:24:000297:000297_4 : 11:23:40:617: Lily of the case with six so take these are not the most pretty confident about these cases and as you rotate them for that gets you know I'm sorting and obedience 10 string cheese and I just forgot to mention one thing to sleep in networks in any machine learning deep Learning Network the probability . 4
11:24:000298:000298_5 : 11:24:04:765: Put on pictures of lactating is different from uncertainty because so that the justices that they come so I suppose if you have 2 3 glasses and it says that they are probably for fast is 21.5 and 10.4 or distributing just telling that it's . 1
11:24:000300:000300_2 : 11:24:27:921: Stop not sorting but it says I owe its profitability that this would be like this with the class and legs 1 . 2
11:25:000301:000301_3 : 11:24:39:554: Thank you . 3
11:25:000302:000302_4 : 11:24:44:683: Set a sleep I would be putting the whole course of these are just some of the coats of it you can always like this and I will be putting all the references which are used when I was exploring the spheres on the espresso . 4
11:25:000303:000303_1 : 11:25:01:752: Yeah . 1
11:25:000304:000304_2 : 11:25:10:883: Yes or no question is that select what are the outputs before and after we are applying the . 2
11:26:000305:000305_3 : 11:25:35:026: You're actually I don't have the link I don't have those images which were before they say biscuit . 3
11:26:000306:000306_4 : 11:25:46:162: Images of before and after that report but they can be played in the sides I'm just showing the output after drop out so maybe I can make sure you got to the top so this diesel after the drop out and so before drop soup before Dropout V we won't be getting any uncertainty of eating sing we wish we getting the probability of the property for this particular so so we have 10 . 4
11:26:000307:000307_1 : 11:25:46:162: 9 visits so we will be getting a property just like a property for each class looking for drop out using before letter about you so when we use Dropout readjust or readjust wing or something things he takes 1400 outputs and then simply find the variance in them which tends to give us the the uncertainty for that . 1
11:27:000308:000308_2 : 11:26:36:538: We thought you know that the output like before drop out and the after drop out . 2
11:27:000309:000309_3 : 11:26:44:683: How to listen to . 3
11:27:000310:000310_4 : 11:26:47:996: Of . 4
11:33:000311:000311_1 : 11:27:11:894: Yeah right right . 1
11:33:000312:000312_2 : 11:27:20:038: Play take me to the John I'm not showing the case without drop out and maybe I can look after the dog we can lick her I had to go to begin may be run without dropping . 2

11:33:000313:000313_3 : 11:32:17:804: Hello . 3
11:33:000314:000314_0 : 11:33:13:921: So what am I am brother how are so I'm from India I am o Mere Lake Cumberland student finally underground I'm going to be doing research with a lighter daily in the field of computer vision vol so I cold sore problems and you can find me as PRS are.my if you were . 4
11:34:000315:000315_1 : 11:33:37:116: So what are you talk about this talk is basically about computer vision so do you know what computer vision is anyone of you . 1
11:34:000316:000316_2 : 11:33:49:258: Short and so this would be explaining the television I would be giving you a call so that you can learn and explore record yourself that would understand everything yourself so and everything would be hard coded in Python and numpy so no no library is only thing it is recorded in fighting so that you can understand what I said and relate to the code itself ok . 2
11:35:000317:000317_3 : 11:34:24:403: Choose a topic so because I'm in too deep learning are we scared so everybody is like using some kind of library chaos tensorflow something and they are late just getting away with the Jewellery so it is very important if you want to explore what the problem is and if you want to deliver a good solution to the problem so people people usually don't understand this . 3
11:35:000318:000318_4 : 11:34:54:545: Help you to understand what computer vision really is so some good Show of Hands how how many of you are new to machine learning . 4
11:35:000319:000319_1 : 11:35:07:319: Oh I feel that great so so anybody who is here to explore machine learning and Alex tell me what machine learning is in their own voice . 1
11:35:000320:000320_2 : 11:35:19:635: Want to answer . 2
11:35:000321:000321_3 : 11:35:23:772: So . 3
11:36:000322:000322_4 : 11:35:25:902: What is machine learning machine learning it's basically I'm watching this way to learn from experience with respect to some class C and this is very happy and very high definition to understand I would break it down something simple sew machine learning is just fancied on for quitting quitting mathematical Sophie so it is just a fancy word for coughing is basically mathematic . 4
11:36:000323:000323_1 : 11:35:55:062: Eid building College mathematics code . 1
11:36:000324:000324_2 : 11:36:05:207: Song for the problems that deals to Sol . 2
11:36:000325:000325_3 : 11:36:10:353: Vision or natural language processing reinforcement learning the new restaurants around and everybody's watching to machine learning deep learning I guess you are all here to jump on the board for that are so let's focus on the computer vision part of the whole scenario so why is it important thing you can tell me . 3
11:36:000326:000326_4 : 11:36:36:309: Important . 4
11:36:000327:000327_1 : 11:36:39:158: Exactly . 1
11:37:000328:000328_2 : 11:36:44:302: What do you what do you reply vision for . 2
11:37:000329:000329_3 : 11:36:50:465: From 3000 from driving Cars 2 Reading to medical imaging capturing everything you require hand eye coordination is also an important part vision is almost everywhere so if you're trying to make an EA play some if you're trying to create a robot vision will be an important part of that so so what are the different task in vision how do we define what are the different for . 3
11:37:000330:000330_4 : 11:37:20:606: From 3000 from driving Cars 2 Reading to medical imaging capturing everything you require hand eye coordination is also an important part vision is almost everywhere so if you're trying to make an EA play some if you're trying to create a robot vision will be an important part of that so so what are the different task in vision how Computer Vision . 4
11:37:000331:000331_1 : 11:37:25:893: There are three major task classification detection and instance segmentation for this is very visual . 1
11:38:000332:000332_2 : 11:37:37:042: And you need to determine whether the objective c o b . 2
11:38:000333:000333_3 : 11:37:43:180: Navigation plus localisation you have to tell whether an objective C of E and your hotel where in the picture is the objectives identification localization detection then this object detection . 3
11:38:000334:000334_0 : 11:37:59:318: The position of heavy objects and you're prepared for the object is and then we have in segmentation this is like how humans perceive everything for instance segmentation I can focus any part of this room with my eyes. How about is how advanced are region is I can focus their anger everything all I can hear is in my vision so that is the epitome of problems instance segmentation is the . 4
11:38:000336:000336_0 : 11:38:31:642: For Problem. We need to crack in computer Vision . 2
11:38:000337:000337_3 : 11:38:36:774: How are you doing today was a famous . 3
11:39:000338:000338_4 : 11:38:40:899: Today's many difficulties in computer vision first of all computer doesn't understand like how we perceive images only understand binary 1010 we have to break it into pixels numbers . 4
11:39:000339:000339_1 : 11:38:55:041: Converted into pixels then there are a lot of problems like with Vodafone station because we need to convert images to fix a big big . 1
11:39:000340:000340_2 : 11:39:07:165: The War of the competition is beautiful beautiful . 2
11:39:000341:000341_3 : 11:39:13:313: Why use before a very inefficient so identify done before so if you guys know about decision trees FM Ghana visa all the letter everybody try to Salvation but it was not very efficient and I'll follow follow for many years which was literally where was not registered with us how do you . 3
11:40:000342:000342_4 : 11:39:42:454: You do a lot of competition in the deep learning is so there's a very famous competition code imaging it mean if you have already bought a meeting . 4
11:40:000343:000343_5 : 11:39:52:979: Images of skill competition held annually and you have 1/4 of 1.5 million images of 15 million . 1
11:40:000344:000344_2 : 11:40:07:125: A lot of companies . 2
11:40:000345:000345_3 : 11:40:14:255: I try to get a . 3
11:40:000346:000346_4 : 11:40:18:399: Indesit competition so there was there was this result and you can see in 2012 that every drop significantly so you can see . 4
11:41:000347:000347_1 : 11:40:31:536: Turn down for what happened in 2012 so the answer is convolution neural a box . 1
11:41:000349:000349_3 : 11:40:43:839: With this new model Court Coleraine Alex and basically and it just a shadow the competition it was a big big events the time I think about it and everybody was like oh yeah we short AI and everything like that so before before getting into corners . 3
11:43:000350:000350_4 : 11:41:05:971: So I mean if you were trying to get into machine learning so I'll tell you from the side so here is the link and you can go to the link and . 4
11:44:000351:000351_1 : 11:41:19:716: Run the chords . 1
11:47:000352:000352_4 : 11:43:41:798: If you want to play galio notebook there any video so this is a good platform to have physio . 4
11:47:000353:000353_1 : 11:44:00:190: Order stuff . 1
11:47:000354:000354_3 : 11:46:59:113: Hello . 3
11:47:000355:000355_4 : 11:47:06:250: I thought . 4
11:47:000356:000356_1 : 11:47:16:398: Google colab . 1
11:48:000357:000357_0 : 11:47:20:539: Discussing such a basis they are only a few fundamentals of machine learning models so you have your data that is also available with you then you have to pay the hypothesis function and you have to have a lot of things which would check the hypothesis function of it is performing and then you have optimizer so you have to
11:48:000358:000358_3 : 11:47:47:709: Thought it's or Alexa work of three functions with the every more Elizabeth II functions are so like you to God and you have in logistic regression so what is it like this situation was the secret question is a fundamental classification models that everybody likes Motors where you get introduced to when you enter in the film where she learnt a lot this dictation is Batman . 3
11:48:000359:000359_4 : 11:48:13:862: Thought it's or Alexa work of three functions with the every more Elizabeth II functions are so like you to God and you have in largest aggression so what is it like this situation was the secret question is a fundamental classification models that everybody likes Motors where you get introduced to when you enter in the film where she It's a basic or more for classification is it does binary classification so you are like I showed you that scored linear classification codes and you can basically go there so this is the sigmoid function is basically the law function yeah I told you what three functions late I'll introduce here for this is a lung function then you have your hypothesis function . 4
11:49:000360:000360_1 : 11:48:42:071: It has all the right here so you can see it and buy it is obvious that you need to edit the parameters and then you have your . 1
11:49:000361:000361_2 : 11:48:53:196: I thought it takes the output from sigmoid functions and I can't be what the losses and then you have gradient gradient reading order St . 2
11:49:000362:000362_3 : 11:49:05:610: What do mice chew through the gradient descent you . 3
11:50:000363:000363_4 : 11:49:11:753: That is how you learn so you need to look like you need you need to know your loss and then you can adjust the parameters so that it . 4
11:50:000364:000364_1 : 11:49:23:899: The card fits the data so I'll explain that in more that so this is from so the situation so forward propagation here forward propagation is here so we are reporting that feeling extremely tired and 3 labels and and we have the random bits in Italy visa in Australia and then we have now been put some random numbers then we take out a loss then we calculate the Greedy . 1
11:50:000365:000365_2 : 11:50:04:045: Obesity . 2
11:50:000366:000366_3 : 11:50:08:118: Pardon me it just of random ways we introduce first so so it's like a fitting an equation but why you through the code so . 3
11:50:000367:000367_4 : 11:50:21:263: So you did or 4 of propagation read ingredients list of us going . 4
11:51:000368:000368_1 : 11:50:32:396: You are here for deep learning, here is the network. 1
11:52:000369:000369_0 : 11:50:40:525: Give me a relief. They also have those three fundamental concepts of max value your loss loss function basically and you have concerns of those players for propagation backpropagation I would be a fine girl so concept of non-linearity so can't separate nonlinearities the data you get from the World Is Not linear linear Innocence like if not already the progress is in one . 2
11:52:000370:000370_0 : 11:51:09:666: Give me a relief. They also have those three fundamental concepts of max value your loss loss on shins basically and you have concerns of those players for propagation backpropagation I would be a fine girl so concept of non-linearity so can't separate nonlinearities the data you get from the World Is Not linear linear like It goes from one 5:10 sometimes Go 1 5 25 I'm just telling you in the form of streaming of number if you get the data so there is not always linear you get known we made it out and to fit nonlinear data or to get out equation which recently needed you need to have some non-linearity in your models so how do we get that non-linearity the answer is softmax; softmax basically gives you . 3
11:52:000371:000371_4 : 11:51:09:666: Fashion in your model said that you can fit nonlinear data basically and we have value for nonlinearity Concepts in forward propagation so far take forward propagation is basically the term used when your data is inserted into your model so your data is inserte into model you get some output and then that is your fault propagation the new basics then then there is backward propagation. 4
11:52:000372:000372_1 : 11:52:13:153: Get your data you do the loss you calculate the loss of what what is the loss loss is the data that the answer the output data generated by your train by your model and original answer the actual fact the answers that the label that you have so it's the difference between them to losses how far away is your answer from the actual answer that is a loss basically so we have different loss functions . 1
11:52:000374:000374_3 : 11:52:44:536: Los Burning . 3
11:53:000375:000375_4 : 11:52:47:510: I saw logical progression is basically a linear model so why does linear model fails . 4
11:53:000376:000376_1 : 11:52:55:612: I already given alongside why does the Leani more to feel anyone anyone . 1
11:53:000377:000377_0 : 11:52:55:612: Linear model
11:53:000378:000378_2 : 11:53:02:116: Psychic because the data that you get from the World Is Not linear if there is only so . 2
11:53:000379:000379_0 : 11:53:12:262: Interesting facts about 5. If you need plugs basically fill on the first sheet ask off . 3
11:54:000380:000380_4 : 11:53:22:414: And that is because . 4
11:54:000381:000381_1 : 11:53:26:574: There were a lot of problems and the problem is Curse of dimensionality so I initially I told you every image is to be separated in the film pixels and we take the pixel count so just imagine you have 28 by 28 that's the height and width of a single image 84 28 by 28 size images and how many different images can you get from a 28 by 28 pixel images . 1
11:54:000382:000382_2 : 11:53:59:283: Audition combination if anybody knows . 2
11:55:000383:000383_3 : 11:54:03:438: We are we have three values of pixels RGB weight and each pixel can be tuned somehow or two that says that the three pixel values can be changed so if you have 28 by 28 that is 784 pixels late 28 by 28 is 784 pixels and each pixel can we can have three different values which each value of UV filter can we change from 0 to 255 so that gives us 256 into 256 to 256 to 56 . 3
11:55:000384:000384_4 : 11:54:47:590: $74 a lot and it's 2028 images of for the images that you take from your camera or the how a lot of people like that a lot bigger than 20 by 28 feet so the Curse of dimensionality is images sizes are increasing and you need to somehow a computer such big amount of images and deep neural networks take on pixel values and then they did to mine so it's unscalable at such a big range . 4
11:56:000385:000385_1 : 11:55:24:732: Curse of dimensionality is that datasets sizes increase in feature number and at some point it becomes . 1
11:56:000386:000386_0 : 11:55:24:732: Infeas
11:56:000387:000387_1 : 11:55:34:859: Other ways than to just use EPO labels because at some point it becomes invisible so we have conversation the Olympics so what problems do convolution neural a Vauxhall I would go for that they Think It's th is social worker citypoint translation invariance palomitas shading and highlighting feature training learning so what is translation invariant . 2
11:56:000388:000388_3 : 11:56:05:004: If you can see this as a cashier . 3
11:57:000389:000389_4 : 11:56:09:175: What is in the centre of the image on the second image the cat is bit farther from the Sun from the centre court at 8 and 4 for your computer it cannot understand it cannot believe what I type is it so it has to go to fix pixel by pixel so we need a winner algorithm an algorithm with somehow they don't mind that this is a god and that is also a card but doesn't read the . 4
11:57:000390:000390_0 : 11:56:36:340: Great Russell. Translation invariance because we can have cat anywhere in the picture and we need a model so that it can detect cats anywhere in the pictures I took a base object here or in the corner or Insider or some . 1
11:57:000391:000391_2 : 11:56:52:490: I saw you transfer ingredients so . 2
11:57:000392:000392_4 : 11:57:08:625: They are Are ugly Jimmy circle circle dot circle can be transformed into a tyre . 4
11:58:000393:000393_1 : 11:57:23:953: Call Toya or in fact your eyes if you can draw good so I decided to think about our girl features you build a thing from ground up so you can take it so good and you can draw out tire on it or you can draw eyelashes are on it as it it becomes I write this article features you start from the basic structure of triangles circles cylinders and then you try to combine it in Sochi . 1
11:58:000394:000394_2 : 11:57:55:092: That it runs out into something believable or something at that you can call human or car are hierarchical features right so are we need an algorithm which detects basic features inside an image and then tries to combine the information it gets from the image and then fight so basically what the . 2
11:59:000395:000395_0 : 11:58:22:237: So that it was really is so here we can see you later in the text very cool features like lines and shapes that. . 3
11:59:000396:000396_1 : 11:58:32:381: Find me come to parameter sharing so each pixel get a parameter of its own so if you are 74 pixels we have 784 video palomitas little things a little biased so if no no we want sum Adam metres for each image so if you have a 28 by 28 image of you somehow we don't need 74 hour meters but we no need of some assembly 114 into 14th para Meetha so that we have left . 1
11:59:000397:000397_2 : 11:59:15:727: It would be done . 2
12:00:000398:000398_3 : 11:59:18:663: so coming back to convnet I can't move no fee I'll explain you how the corners does it in real time so whenever I told you right now it's basically image processing or feature feature lodging so what about does a Koala koala do is it takes the image and exciting features and it goes back of an array of popular numbers and I'll be called as features extracted . 3
12:00:000399:000399_4 : 11:59:49:789: These features Are the features go into your logistic regression remember that was the basic basic fundamental model of machine learning to call me so nothing but feature learning . 4
12:00:000400:000400_1 : 12:00:02:930: Are models so it was learnt the features it throws out some features and then you get a feature adding which would be processed by some kind of classify at the end so that section of convnet corners has a small boxes or kilometres or metres which shade all over so that is how you do Power metres Shearing and then you have side side lick each let me show you so if you are so . 1
12:01:000401:000401_2 : 12:00:03:930: Image . 2
12:01:000402:000402_3 : 12:00:36:289: If you assume that is our image and yellow box is a power metre box and it is basically multiplying a 3 digit in the red inside the yellow box and bring the sum of all the multiples . 3
12:01:000403:000403_4 : 12:00:37:289:  So a parameter box gets every part of the image . 4
12:02:000404:000404_0 : 12:01:02:624: 3 part of the image you get a source of sum of products and it gets no fear into NEXO part of the image and then you have pool layers. Pool layers is basically some things are basically a compressor image to you take for pixel compressor and create a single pixel . 1
12:02:000405:000405_2 : 12:01:29:761: this is how pool layer work to take full pictures from an image you can compress them now it's on you to how how to compress them you take four pixels and take the highest amount of a number for pixel and we take it into the next up part of the image so we get from 1156 we take the 6th part of the A66 number from the image as if you forward . 2
12:02:000406:000406_3 : 12:01:56:899: So we have nonlinearities because data is non linear in the sense in the same speaker only me ideas is basically a very quiet everywhere because it is not linear so we have to pay for fighting non linearities we have leave a special functions . 3
12:02:000407:000407_4 : 12:02:17:042: The rest of the next regular leg regular in the same I told you you can use logistic regression svm decision trees and everything like that so convnets, it is basically image processing but it's fancy image processing and then you have rest rest of the rest of . 4
12:03:000408:000408_1 : 12:02:38:173: Let's go to a cool visualisation I have it here . 1
12:03:000409:000409_2 : 12:02:51:306: How do I switch . 2
12:03:000410:000410_3 : 12:03:00:444: I draw an input here. 3
12:03:000411:000411_4 : 12:03:14:571: I drew a 2 here And if it is an input basically right then there's this condition your hair so it tries to extract some features out of the image this is a first layer then you have done something that is a feeling that I told you about so it so you can see the image get School . 4
12:04:000412:000412_1 : 12:03:37:709: So . 1
12:04:000413:000413_2 : 12:03:40:852: Nice compression layer and then we have another convolution layer it does the same thing its sides does palomitas over and over again and tries to learnt few different features which are important and then you know you get another downsampling you get another you get fully connected layers just to It's like you're like a lot of circulation basically so fully connected layer . 2
12:04:000414:000414_3 : 12:04:09:006: regular deep deep networks so and then you have fully connected layer number two and then finally there's an outputput it . 3
12:04:000416:000416_4 : 12:04:23:145: floor just to touch by digital . 4
12:04:000417:000417_1 : 12:04:24:145: All this:04:30:298: You're Work. 1
12:04:000419:000419_2 : 12:04:33:441: Ok . 2
12:04:000420:000420_4 : 12:04:36:637: Turn . 4
12:05:000421:000421_1 : 12:04:40:783: Lol just distrubute the link of this so you know so you can check it out yourself and then have a . 1
12:05:000422:000422_2 : 12:04:53:914: A test in Keras, I have it here. 2
12:05:000423:000423_3 : 12:05:01:667: And . 3
12:05:000424:000424_4 : 12:05:21:579: AH Sonic so . 4
12:05:000425:000425_1 : 12:05:32:987: Are . 1
12:05:000426:000426_0 : 12:05:38:108: The fuzzy image. I . 2
12:05:000427:000427_3 : 12:05:46:278: Model and what is compiling . 3
12:06:000428:000428_4 : 12:05:51:477: area in real time so this is the world calling . 4
12:06:000429:000429_0 : 12:05:51:477: It'all done in real time
12:06:000430:000430_1 : 12:05:57:620: the pooling is down Sampling basically . 1
12:06:000431:000431_2 : 12:06:00:763: What does a 93322 minutes training right now so let It Rain for a few minutes and . 2
12:06:000432:000432_3 : 12:06:15:232: So I can tell you about this model stop won the competition the competition I started . 3
12:07:000433:000433_1 : 12:06:24:368: 2012 Arena with the defenders in the pillow for computer vision for this is AlexNet it broke the record and by the way current record is held by a company somewhere in China and Company basically brother label 21.1 1.3/:/ so if . 4
12:07:000434:000434_2 : 12:06:51:519: The human error is somewhere around 5/:/ so that makes it are you when you're giving 100m are you meant would classify 5 images wrong but the model does it only a single time we have in the human . 2
12:07:000435:000435_3 : 12:07:11:644: She looked ossification for now this is tofu good for coming years so this so you can see the train I hear the layers are less then the next will win at the layers are more and in 2015 the layers so basically a lot so people as a starting place where are layers and layers and layers to just get to the point where they break the records so . 3
12:08:000436:000436_4 : 12:07:41:790: From a single talk you can basically understand the lack of the Architecture is because they're just . 4
12:08:000437:000437_1 : 12:07:51:942: Stacking the layers again and again so you can just understand a single concept and you can understand a lot of models I so . 1
12:09:000438:000438_0 : 12:08:04:946: The barrier to entrance is really low.
12:09:000439:000439_3 : 12:08:04:946: Is a lot so that is why you need to try to understand it and yeah that's about it thank you for your attention and any questions you may . 3
12:09:000440:000440_4 : 12:08:24:263: I don't wish . 4
12:09:000441:000441_2 : 12:08:50:650: Are you wanting away if you only choose to view to 256 . 2
12:10:000442:000442_4 : 12:09:19:017: Why do we use the filter like 256 and and then 128 ? . 4
12:10:000443:000443_0 : 12:09:28:148: Forbidden results like that so is there a picture of an ziegler images Michael images of different dimension it was but it was differently today Andrew NG basically told about this so he was like are not talking about different sizes so that was because of the processing inside the computer because it makes the most efficiently so that was something that that was discovered after
12:10:000444:000444_2 : 12:09:59:272: A lot of similar images and then there we came to the result that to 53 by 256 cm you can use 303323 A-Team by Ed and . 2
12:10:000445:000445_3 : 12:10:16:406: Something that people follow as a trend, so . 3
12:11:000446:000446_4 : 12:10:23:544: Or something like that because you can always with you say it . 4 Hi fellow tran
12:11:000448:000448_1 : 12:10:29:673: Scriber Ok . 1
12:11:000449:000449_2 : 12:10:45:790: So you gonna . 2
12:11:000450:000450_3 : 12:11:07:952: So that's the question was if you have a different size of image that would that be want to feed into the AlexNet or something standard next . 3
12:12:000451:000451_4 : 12:11:21:107: Am I right? . 4
12:12:000452:000452_0 : 12:11:25:266: you are what you can do it if the images or smaller than 200 - 200 pixel image so what we can do is we can do or padding that zero padding so we can just put a border around the image and model ignores the border because it doesn't know what the water board or is she just ignores that so we can put up the car 227
12:12:000453:000453_2 : 12:12:01:450: Are so that we can see to 27 by 227 image but it would be cabin zero padding around image . 2
12:12:000454:000454_3 : 12:12:11:585: So it is I don't want the image it's not under architecture . 3
12:12:000455:000455_4 : 12:12:18:719: Yes we take . 4
12:13:000456:000456_0 : 12:12:22:864: Are you have a 200 by 200 pixel image right then I then what I do is
12:13:000457:000457_2 : 12:12:37:990: So I don't suppose 27 pixels the pixel amount would be zero so we put with black like for you and for the computer it will be presenting information so it would leave that part and refocus on the image part . 2
12:13:000458:000458_0 : 12:12:58:125: Much more bigger. So, you can stride basically you can take different parts of the image so we can do what we can do is we can create to 27 by 227 window and then we can straight over the window to find to detect object . 3
12:13:000459:000459_4 : 12:13:20:264: Yeah it's that bad as I doubt if it is done in . 4
12:14:000460:000460_0 : 12:13:27:417: Localisation of detection techniques you use this because you are you a feel like I said driving cars late so Raven girls have basically no pixel Arma back they don't have standard values ways can everything window by window and that isn't very fast. so, you are so, when when when there's somebody . 1
12:14:000461:000461_2 : 12:13:50:557: Twitter scan the whole team of window by window and just when it detects so . 2
12:14:000462:000462_3 : 12:13:57:684: The I can tell you about it but it would get a lot a lot longer . 3
12:14:000464:000464_2 : 12:14:23:177: So the question was how do we choose a particular . 2
12:15:000465:000465_3 : 12:14:29:308: Look for 4 tonight so it is all depending on the image it is it is the opinion that asks so far object or object detection and classification the usual go to model is GGG because it is much simpler to understand . 3
12:15:000466:000466_0 : 12:14:47:458: Then you go to the complex model Satan like a resonator and other more basic start or go to model is VAT and then you go to racenet and find other other things. Anna Cartoon Network send a lot of things so it is like that depended they are not image different . 4
12:15:000467:000467_2 : 12:15:11:631: Thank you . 2
12:16:000468:000468_0 : 12:15:13:748: So the question is do I have to
12:16:000469:000469_4 : 12:15:28:912: So the question is how do we decorate a corner accommodation late so I told you Lucia neural network is basically feature engineering the regularization park comes in the classification so you can use you can use your draw boats and L2 regularization techniques in the classification you do anything inside the corner there's one of people called normalisation which we do inside the . 4
12:16:000470:000470_1 : 12:16:12:045: Russian Roulette book for Dartford . 1
12:16:000471:000471_2 : 12:16:16:198: Different part of the week or sometimes we leave nationalisation because it does like it does regularize the thing what we can get away with using a video about at the end and it just what . 2
12:16:000472:000472_3 : 12:16:36:346: Thank you for the . 3
12:17:000473:000473_4 : 12:16:41:483: Sorry . 4
12:17:000474:000474_1 : 12:16:48:621: Number of epochs so the question is how do we use either few hyperbolic number of epochs and things like that so again it is not dependent . 1
12:17:000475:000475_2 : 12:17:06:750: You start with 10 or 24 or whatever works fine and let him in you'll see if it is overfitting or not if it is not overfitting you generally done for a few more epochs it is basically hidden file IO palomitas like a fox and . 2
12:17:000476:000476_3 : 12:17:24:900: Running late and all you didn't raise but since we had a lot of people are doing deep learning right now so there are few standard hyperballad so . 3
12:18:000477:000477_0 : 12:17:39:049: Are any of the optimizer you can get a particle you
12:18:000478:000478_2 : 12:17:47:215: RJ45 to 10 then check your validation testing go and if it is overfitting than you might start from the and video support . 2
12:18:000479:000479_3 : 12:18:06:506: Simulation . 3
12:18:000480:000480_4 : 12:18:09:881: Justin . 4
12:19:000481:000481_1 : 12:18:20:008: Good . 1
12:19:000482:000482_3 : 12:18:46:105: Ghost cases to II e-610 it is all opening 2 with the higher probability even though it is in the left corner . 3
12:19:000483:000483_4 : 12:18:59:248: Yeah this is Kosovo . 4
12:19:000484:000484_2 : 12:19:13:598: Directions off on the topic but I know so I suppose the question was how do we . 2
12:19:000485:000485_0 : 12:19:23:729: For the dick a detecting a particle of object name it's right from here in the Call of War in addition to classification what are the different techniques that we do for detection rate so so one part One Pilots like you use and the windows window take me there. I told . 3
12:19:000486:000486_4 : 12:19:46:887: What . 4
12:20:000487:000487_1 : 12:19:51:019: Exactly so u v . 1
12:20:000488:000488_2 : 12:19:55:156: Go and her point so there are they like to be select hyperbaric windows . 2
12:21:000489:000489_3 : 12:20:04:301: Text rectangular boxes over like a lot of rectangular boxes over the image and 20 rectangular box over time is Saturday cover every part of the image and you feed it to the condition and network in in up in a parallel fashion so everything gets groped and fit inside inside 20 live so you feel at 20 out of 20 Windows so it goes into 2 in inside the countries in the world . 3
12:21:000490:000490_4 : 12:20:33:442: Inditex are 20 different Windows as a as new images basically so if you draw a lot of boxes are somehow they would be a box which would get the major part of 2 knot in entire time number 2 multimedia part of you and then it would try to look Local eyes so that box becomes the local . 4
12:21:000491:000491_0 : 12:20:57:586: So that is what I do with old are in the setting object detection is somewhat good instance segmentation instrumentation was like if I have to so I can afford proper pixel by pixel identification and that is the epitome of the problems we face in computer vision so that is not
12:22:000492:000492_2 : 12:21:24:708: Faster rcnn it sounded a lot of which are trying to solve the problem you're talking about like pixel to pixel masking of the particular object what we are trying to track down people are working to correct that it is not a problem that is all right now but the detection could be done later you draw a lot of boxes and some other some part of the box or tails that ok the . 2
12:22:000493:000493_3 : 12:21:53:830: Here is a lot more than propagating of getting a 2 in the upper part somewhere that is how it was . 3
12:25:000494:000494_4 : 12:22:05:967: Any other way . 4
12:25:000495:000495_1 : 12:22:12:103: Thank you . 1

14:09:000514:000514_3 : 14:09:30:582: Hey guys it's just learnt a lot of us are trying to buy you go to bed . 3
14:10:000515:000515_4 : 14:09:46:222: Ring sexy back to life just took its musical going to be a boxing in general and how we can use NLP . 4
14:10:000516:000516_1 : 14:09:56:350: Daily lives in our can improve our lives so I'm never . 1
14:10:000517:000517_2 : 14:10:02:484: India . 2
14:10:000518:000518_3 : 14:10:05:607: Skitarii . 3
14:11:000519:000519_4 : 14:10:09:061: Start off with this ring size how language is complicated maybe it's not very obvious to humans but when you look at video objective Leven you remove that morning they would be having a head take example this I ate pizza with olives and his friends now either way eating people now or lose an hour people so things get complicated when you take things out of context . 4
14:11:000520:000520_1 : 14:10:35:185: The thing I'm trying to see you an example would be local High School Dropout cut by half so now we know that we don't actually go around killing people in half so good sentences that number of people who dropped out at local schools droppet out by half an otherwise I so did you see a kid who has a telescope or through a telescope so . 1
14:11:000521:000521_2 : 14:11:02:315: When we are using language and giving up Giving In 24th your wages what you fancy doing a mind of building this model of the world and we take that for granted when we talk to each other and it's true that context so we can understand each other otherwise if objectives of communication . 2
14:12:000523:000523_3 : 14:11:28:594: Language So they just swan xkcd comic I really like her and it supports appoint what I'm trying to put across it makes highlighted so a person says to another . 3
14:12:000524:000524_0 : 14:11:39:732: Actually, I could care less and then I'll go and collect them I think you mean you couldn't care less send you could care less imply that you carefully Simone I don't know where is unbelievably complicated brains just intro oya trying in Vain to connect with one another and blindly flinging was Into
14:12:000525:000525_1 : 14:12:03:866: Contacting stop texting me and every listener interface science in their own way . 1
14:12:000526:000526_2 : 14:12:11:001: It's a glorious skill you never know if I work for sure what anybody any of the boys army 21 all you can do is try and get better at getting your words affect people so you can have a chance of finding one to make them feel something that the way you want them to feel basically everything is pointless . 2
14:12:000527:000527_3 : 14:12:29:134: She goes on to say "I assume you're giving me tips on how to interpret was because you want me to feel less alone if so thank you that means a lot to me" what you suggest running through my sentence is Rudimental checklist so you can show how well you know your grandma or language then it's basic I could care less . 3
14:13:000528:000528_1 : 14:12:45:308: So where does nlp comes language for . 1
14:13:000529:000529_2 : 14:12:52:424: That is some really talk to each other English French these are languages and the way you communicate with each other is called national language when we using languages to programme computer socket programming languages . 2
14:13:000530:000530_3 : 14:13:09:548: Of how we communicate with each other how to make it better how to understand it . 3
14:13:000531:000531_4 : 14:13:16:090: How do we do NLP? . 4
14:14:000532:000532_1 : 14:13:20:714: basically we can't just go on shouting whether the computer it's not going to make any sense to its what we have to do is the hardest different techniques called bag of words . 1
14:14:000533:000533_2 : 14:13:40:863: You can do is take something like a TF-IDF ( term frequency inverse document frequency ) we can you take a document and find out the number of times a word comes in that particular document or something like and watch which order become that's when the light comes and was himself so see b o w s country is Tiger Woods Instagram is it going to . 2
14:14:000534:000534_3 : 14:14:04:003: I'm going to keep them for now . 3
14:14:000535:000535_4 : 14:14:07:351: No sew bag of words manga what is basically a way of extracting information from the words from the sentences in the documents we already have . 4
14:14:000536:000536_1 : 14:14:18:486: Radio this one . 1
14:15:000537:000537_2 : 14:14:21:678: As you can see in the slide are there to bring your documents are we comparing the frequency of the words in those documents and we use other features from text then we can do other than machine and deep learning on them but the one disadvantage of back what does that information about all is lost and order in language means a lot to us because all I Was A linear so that's why the Sydney . 2
14:15:000538:000538_3 : 14:14:48:795: What's why this technique has been used int classical natural sourcing techniques used for I think the last 40 or 50 years but I was given the rising machine if this is what we don't use any more . 3
14:15:000540:000540_4 : 14:15:04:265: The Skip training for converting goes into these features that you can get into later . 4
14:15:000541:000541_1 : 14:15:12:414: How to get onto monster machine learning I think you're better . 1
14:15:000542:000542_2 : 14:15:18:564: I'm not going to go too much into it . 2
14:16:000543:000543_3 : 14:15:21:701: ML in the context of NLP we take those words in the document in the document we have and we can put them into features something that the models can understand and then we use supervisor answer why is ossification the main difference between machine learning and deep learning is that in . 3
14:16:000544:000544_4 : 14:15:46:834: Classical techniques like I'm in all day and another . 4
14:16:000545:000545_1 : 14:15:55:956: The thing with machines glass canopy Morris's be used to manually take out features from text things like tf-idf and word count and all the other ones I showed you but what happens in deep learning is it says manually giving it feature instead of telling the model that this is probably important in this isn't we let them do the work and that's beautiful a'll be no . 1
14:16:000546:000546_2 : 14:16:20:081: Calculate this is something that only make sense if This World Is Coming along then it's probably important to be let the machine do that working we just take that wasn't with them in a form the machine can understand . 2
14:17:000547:000547_3 : 14:16:34:008: How do we take these words and put them in a form machine can understand that would be embeddings because machines can't understand text because each character sketch me something to him but if you can go the character into ASCII number and any 7TJ there is something though machine can deal with . 3
14:17:000548:000548_4 : 14:16:53:754: Too many things so what we essentially doing this . 4
14:17:000549:000549_1 : 14:17:00:907: Model how is that we take these words and we represent them with arbitrary list of floating point numbers you can see I like this movie very much is represented by 5 different separate floating point numbers and we let the more I do the cleaning and learn what is the definition which is ideal for this kind of word so maybe of New York and Paris would be so similar in the Grave . 1
14:18:000550:000550_2 : 14:17:28:017: A nice picture from gloss paper I would you can do essentially after training these word embeddings to a moral I go to work or something what you can essentially do is take the word vector font and subtract the word vector from a woman from and ha and you get an ankle with Windows keyboard was it just blew everybody's mind . 2
14:18:000551:000551_3 : 14:17:53:140: That sort of understanding just follow these basic 5 decimal numbers is crazy just having that so . 3
14:18:000552:000552_4 : 14:18:04:295: What is essentially what rate in the context which we have inside a head which are embedded into this machine learning models and this is one way this is one with really good way of doing it . 4
14:18:000553:000553_1 : 14:18:17:063: When you come to NLP the most recently so that is going on different kind of problems because we can tackle just language in Genesis where you wash and re topic so we take specific small because . 1
14:18:000554:000554_2 : 14:18:31:199: Are in very small narrow context we can just sort everything you mean and mean what we try to be big things apart into small problem is also dictionary time and then he said we make boxes and through that . 2
14:19:000555:000555_3 : 14:18:47:332: Show and then we take before moonraker down to smaller problems . 3
14:19:000556:000556_4 : 14:18:54:468: Dealing with one which I'm going to be talking specifically about is language modelling which is essentially the task of predicting the next word what I'm doing right now essentially is automator language modeling I have to seeing everyone I'm thinking what to see the next tram station is pretty obvious from the name from one language to another question answering take . 4
14:19:000557:000557_1 : 14:19:12:601: Dealing with one which I'm going to be talking specifically about is language modelling which is essentially the task of predicting the next word what I'm doing right now essentially is automator like this morning I have to seeing everyone I'm thinking what to see the next tram station is pretty obvious from the name Take me to win reading comprehension texts and then be sent that text me need to answer questions how many cats were there what does it seem like something like that . 1
14:20:000558:000558_2 : 14:19:13:601: Text classification that would be something like what you do sentiment analysis so whether differences positive or negative weather Sidmouth sarcastic or not whether something seven or eight thoughts on this occasion . 2
14:20:000559:000559_3 : 14:19:40:988: How do I know if it's relation would be something like if I say John and William talking to each other he fell into a phone so who is he in this context is genre is the other person that's good . 3
14:20:000560:000560_4 : 14:19:41:988: Forest beating of the world what is an ounce in to understand all these things to learn a language better . 4
14:20:000561:000561_1 : 14:20:03:414: As I mentioned earlier language in our language English, French in the things we talk to each other with the sequential in nature so we come one after another and they only makes sense when they come one after another . 1
14:20:000562:000562_2 : 14:20:20:344: when we're using these modelswe trying to teach the smallest to understand a language what we do is we use sequential models because this is like a Time season 1 output when input after another and again do you know how much about what we can have a single output example of sentiment analysis sentence positive a block of text which is like 11 x app and then we go to the entire . 2
14:21:000563:000563_3 : 14:20:46:475: input match between Aston Villa translation where each word of couple of words together have a single word is the translation . 3
14:21:000564:000564_4 : 14:20:56:413: Now to see some examples of these sequences models article a _recurrent neural network . 4
14:22:000565:000565_1 : 14:21:05:571: Death of Eleanor Cox Joshua Feldman who sadly died this year in Eastleigh it be used as they call simplified Ireland and what they said she is so in what sequence is essentially are in Puerto different types test and what the greeting for letting your network cyst or what is the advantage of a hidden state where the thing how they have a hidden state across a if a sentence has something like . 1
14:22:000566:000566_2 : 14:21:36:729: "I am very happy" so that the one that came before "I" and the word this coming after am is it important for understanding what I'm representing the situation so what is initially we have here is a hidden say so whenever I'm giving an import I initially goes an egg 0 and goes in and out as X1 and very would be excuse and I'm just keeps going so we have a hidden state that . 2
14:22:000567:000567_3 : 14:22:02:872: Father Ted which is unticking all the sin and processing this information it's our last min we want to the next time step . 3
14:22:000568:000568_4 : 14:22:11:766: So when we're dealing with record new network save . 4
14:23:000569:000569_1 : 14:22:18:900: Sudden concrete very long sentences very large sequences what happened and let me just remind me to all these were through all these numbers calculating sending them back to . 1
14:23:000570:000570_2 : 14:22:34:049: Find out what is important what's not . 2
14:23:000571:000571_1 : 14:22:35:049:  The problem of vanishing gradient comes in Vito van Dyk we keep on multiplying something with point 1.1.1 it just explode or vanishes all that she is it when is 100 a dextrose and it's .1 or something in a decimal it explodes so very little things can we can be made to the recruiter network to the weight of the network is what we think she do text address that is in a way to New . 3
14:23:000572:000572_4 : 14:23:02:342: LFC how much is an ounce of memories which has a couple of a decent gates and Elaine Ford forget and awkward Gait which helps us in doing these things from remembering and remembering and forgetting the right kind things is implementation of the LSTM Gate and to give you an intuitive example see a picture and we are free this into the same what I said she would be cool and . 4
14:24:000573:000573_1 : 14:23:26:464: Understand what is it for getting the picture may be the location of the Pokémon Snorlax in this example isn't very important what I should say is that he looks like he looks in pain and what I should ignore so his dietary preferences are probably not very important in figuring out whether he's being attacked or not listening to the example if there's an input for getting a . 1
14:24:000574:000574_0 : 14:23:50:594: Ok moving onto unsupervised pretraining and I'm going to want to the landing of the dark but just to try on this. when we start a new task we don't start from scratch. when I'm when you talking save centre second section for example when I try to understand sarcasm when I wasn't really wanna tell you I sent had all the
14:24:000575:000575_0 : 14:24:16:751: So why should I monitor somebody so what which is it should I do here is he could ask in bed all the information of language are we have into that particular model and use of change model to perform a separate. And this is true to be very helpful and computer vision as well and now since they are playing. In language don't tell that's pretty useless . 3
14:25:000576:000576_4 : 14:24:40:879: Examples needed to attend rehab my patient . 4
14:25:000577:000577_1 : 14:24:47:413: So I can you search me for language modelling which is basically a task of predicting one word after another as you can see your initial come across one word and then the next one is we take the condition tropic of the four strong and second for the tour similar in the second word . 1
14:25:000578:000578_2 : 14:25:06:545: predict from a large vocabulary words which would be all the words in the document you have to figure out which word to say next which again let me find out I'm doing right now in my head but form order to do that it's very hard because we have lost Gilbert's disease play 3000 . 2
14:25:000580:000580_3 : 14:25:28:008: So what you might feel a bus or something like again on behalf another . 3
14:25:000581:000581_4 : 14:25:34:989: Is considered to be NLP imagenet. 4
14:26:000582:000582_1 : 14:25:38:118: That's the same field emission 80/:/ as someone I think one of the previous talk highlighted was one of the most influential moments and networks that use a normal ep 10 on a mission if that's what . 1
14:26:000583:000583_2 : 14:25:52:252: Now what can you do with language modelling since we have a large network and we change it on something like the entire works of Shakespeare in this example of allusion providing so on the surface of it is understood based on the millions of labelled as normal even if you're taking examples are in any task you'll need to provide machine learning or deep learning models examples . 2
14:26:000584:000584_3 : 14:26:17:386: This is what is supposed to be based on a number of features in language modelling the word itself says on the label so everyone at every time step you have the labour which is the next world so when you essentially have enormous large label did I said that you can't find any other task . 3
14:26:000585:000585_4 : 14:26:38:203: This language mode has been given inputs like this one which is from Shakespeare play . 4
14:27:000586:000586_1 : 14:26:44:564: Essentialy training when you start It just gives a gibberish something like this is a metre calculator can be with . 1
14:27:000587:000587_2 : 14:26:54:706: don't understand anything, there's no punctuation but as he moon what if you keep on training what happens is it start to understand again this dick so very very long time so in Morden and see what we try to do is use certain techniques like attention which he can see how well you have even small on your network within larger . 2
14:27:000588:000588_3 : 14:27:20:853: Figaro tension . 3
14:27:000589:000589_4 : 14:27:23:972: So this examples of tension I'm not going to go into details because that is another talk in itself . 4
14:28:000590:000590_1 : 14:27:30:119: How do something like a point of where to find do something like that so to help us understand and make the connacht optimisation easier and faster anyway chilli after a long time of training you get something like this which this is an output of a model before and I don't think I atleast couldn't shade this perform an actual Shakespeare text so that it says you can as you can see it in my . 1
14:28:000591:000591_2 : 14:27:55:253: How do something like a point of where to find do something like that so to help us understand and make the connacht optimisation easier and faster anyway chilli after a long time of training you get something like this which this is an output of a model before and I don't think I atleast couldn't shade this perform an actual Shakespeare text so that it says you Zero Punctuation is . 2
14:28:000592:000592_3 : 14:27:56:253: Grammar is fine the words are similar to the way Shakespeare uses recovery . 3
14:29:000594:000594_4 : 14:28:05:618: So if you want to do some more this is language model which is been seen on recipes and it just makes up new recipes with something like half teaspoon of ground beer or a single point of sugar with ridiculous to us for language . 4
14:30:000597:000597_1 : 14:29:14:766: Yes of the question is inclusion task GPS are helpful but I am getting chased in straight losses is whether it is helpful in language or not and if it is and how so for computers domain networks with you as I mean I got the music . 1
14:32:000598:000598_2 : 14:29:53:900: Find a good thing about CNNs at the very least you can do parallel processing on GPUs and that doesn't work out here because what it is Libby using NLP it something like corrective exercise able to because we need to take things in order and an image the translation invariant so it doesn't matter which body image of paying attention to see all the other matters so . 2
14:32:000599:000599_0 : 14:30:18:068: It's hard but since this is been going on for 10 Years Eve come over the door techniques and models which can run fast so much much fat should I order of magnitude of 10 or 20 even using these models are Nintendo switch on GPS. . 3


Visualising the world  of competitive  programming with  Python  Anuj Menta


14:32:000600:000600_1 : 14:31:34:737: Hi hello veryone . 1
14:32:000601:000601_2 : 14:32:15:885: I'm from India so I'll be talking about visualising the role of computer programming . 2
14:32:000602:000602_3 : 14:32:23:049: T's been about 5 years since I first told my programming my first fighting coats and I'm a mathematics major from any material technology India I work with American Express for any other . 3
14:33:000603:000603_4 : 14:32:36:215: And I am very passionate about speak to me so that is like solving the likely be played on with puzzles like Rubik's Cube and it takes about 10 to 15 seconds to sort . 4
14:33:000604:000604_1 : 14:32:48:358: So a little bit about the talk the talk is going to be divided into 2 parts where I'll be talking about the entire process I will be away the prodigal son shirts because in . 1
14:34:000605:000605_3 : 14:33:03:485: involved in projects maybe I didn't want scraping a website Gathering And I'll be talking about one for the project was it what is competitive programming so has anyone worked with competitive programming any computer programmers ok great so I just give you a brief about computer programming computer programming is Vicks objective and achieving the objective a specific and things like the number of iterations but the program has to exist . 3
14:34:000606:000606_0 : 14:33:43:766: Specific amount of time LED ceiling one second or 3 seconds depending on the programming language using so the website I have used a Sky code for sis.com it is a online programming contest very have questions and that this letter structure of the website you can use any language you want there are different types of questions like that scene dynamic programming greedy add . 4
14:34:000607:000607_1 : 14:34:08:888: Just basic math or implementation and it also has a lot of people solving the question so for example if it for a b c d e f that is one contest which is conducted globally and I just a number of people website I have used to screen so the data set is basically programs people have written so there are actually about . 1
14:35:000608:000608_2 : 14:34:40:019: 500k Programmes that people have written in about 16 different languages java c c python and everything and the . 2
14:35:000609:000609_3 : 14:34:51:150: For about 3500 questions and like for example you can see different type of questions the implementation dynamic programming greedy brute force so the total number of type of question is 5260 and submission sample 30 countries to this is a data said we have used for the entire analysis and I have performed a few visualisations and I also give you the actual object . 3
14:36:000610:000610_0 : 14:35:17:323: Entire project so the project started off with trying to distinguish the way beginners code in Python with respect to expert programming experience programme objectives of the project and have read it a few visualisations so the first and foremost is the number of the years the person has been coding till now so this is basically the chart as you can see
14:36:000611:000611_1 : 14:35:47:467: So it's it's kind of beginning for that the people who come onto the platform to learn computer programming usually about 2 years and it goes on like the harder it gets so it's like they're very large number of people stick to 6 to 7 years and they are mostly language you can call experienced programmers . 1
14:36:000612:000612_0 : 14:36:13:594: This is a complex visualisation of this is basically language used for solving the problem was is the type of the problem so so this is like implementation dynamic programming greedy math and brute force so if you can see I usually Python is not the best language to use to solve questions in competitive programming so it is usually in
14:37:000613:000613_3 : 14:36:40:718: Dial equations in computer programming in that is one area where Python is still working on so . 3
14:37:000614:000614_4 : 14:36:50:857: Is the rating of a user so every user has a particular ratings based on the number of questions is able to solve in a contest so this is simply the number of competitors available to solve a question what is the rating of the question which belongs . 4
14:37:000615:000615_1 : 14:37:08:997: So this is more like if a question is difficult then own we can only see people at a higher rating serving this is 289 so people would rating of 2500 to 3000 questions with obvious . 1
14:38:000616:000616_2 : 14:37:29:135: Evolution of language over years I'm only compared to languages Python Java and C as you can see is used by about 80/:/ of the programme was on the platform python and Java about to 15/:/ . 2
14:38:000617:000617_0 : 14:37:45:274: Now this is the average rating of one particular category of questions let's say we pick up dynamic programming so the average rating of users solving a particular type of question has been decreasing over the years which goes on to say that more and more people are trying to sort different difficult questions and the questions are
14:38:000618:000618_4 : 14:38:11:455: Easy enough we can see that more people are trying to solve the questions in different areas on . 4
14:39:000619:000619_1 : 14:38:19:497: So this is simply trying to see which categories can be ranked as the most difficult categories so if you are fast fourier transform our floors are one of the most difficult questions in computer programming so this is simply the average rating of all the uses this solve this paritcular kind of questions . 1
14:39:000620:000620_3 : 14:38:41:646: Oh yes so this is a kind of My Favorites of this is the number of lines of programming and this visualisation specific only to buy them obviously this is a number of lines of code is used against his rating so this goes on to say that experienced programmers time to get things done in less number of lines of code come by 2 List comprehensions that basically takes one line compared to go for loop which is written in at least three or four lines so that is kind of word this observation is . 3
14:39:000621:000621_4 : 14:39:19:127: demographics . 4
14:39:000622:000622_1 : 14:39:22:264: Bad Farm has the highest number of users from India and China Joshua validation is it but the highest rating age rating is the average of the top 100 users from a country so that is how it's it's ranks so so basically this analysis has been performed on a fertility describe myself so this is 500000 randomly sample code . 1
14:40:000623:000623_2 : 14:39:51:427: Million codes on the platform . 2
14:40:000624:000624_3 : 14:39:54:565: Would you do that and I only had to do this is on my laptop so I won't I randomly sampled them to obtain a 500000 sample of programs and then be analysis is performed at . 3
14:40:000625:000625_4 : 14:40:07:686: Briefly over the web scraping process I've used and how the pipeline was constructed like which website how do you choose a website or even after you choose your website how do you actually get the right elements so has anyone use web scraping before in their job in any time a couple of France . 4
14:41:000626:000626_1 : 14:40:27:822: Meaning meaningful information from any website you would want b dandelions website e-commerce website taxi aggregator so everyone needs are too late let's even if I want to see . 1
14:41:000627:000627_0 : 14:40:42:962: Play some comedy on Amazon it would be way it would make my life easier to just data scraper which hello to me like give me an alarm of the prize every day so it is a very simple escape that's the most basic implementation so if you can see you are so. libraries which I usually use in Python scraping beautifulsoup scrapy and requests . 2
14:41:000628:000628_3 : 14:41:08:102: selenium is a browser automation to it's not usually used for web scraping but that's kind of a hack to scrape websites which have dynamic content loaded . 3
14:42:000629:000629_4 : 14:41:19:241: So are this is kind of the entire pipeline which subject of us to distinguish dim the lights for grammar is experienced programmers and then choosing the right outside so this is what are soda multiple websites which have computer programming like Code forces top code and stuff like that forces has every program written by a user publicly available so every other . 4
14:42:000630:000630_1 : 14:41:47:421: Have you the other users programs publicly available so this was about said I could choose and you should also try to make the website multiple times and see also for example of you website are not really friendly so they have a robot txt file which says that you're not allowed to scrape this particular section of the website you should be checking these prior to your exercice. 1
14:43:000631:000631_2 : 14:42:10:546: some websites have a limit rate let's see if we only allow 40 to 50 degrees and minutes so if you're planning to scrape on Million Voices it's going to take you ages so unless you use proxies to use my life assessing so these Are a Few parameters you need to see when you are trying to choose a website how friendly is the website or stuff like that abuse online . 2
14:43:000632:000632_0 : 14:42:32:673: It's such a big down to a very simple structure example user rating the place from where the user is how many years should be so different. They don't you don't get all the information in one API call or one user request you need to get them differently separately so let's say you first axis or users rating then you'll see all the questions he has sold and then you try to figure out . 3
14:43:000633:000633_4 : 14:42:59:786: Is the category of the question being referred to in this context . 4
14:43:000634:000634_0 : 14:43:06:927: Different Pieces of information you need to gather and then put them together but also are the screen free by trade with me in that for example let's say you will come across a section which is Michelle been blocked let's say you've scraped continuously for a few hours and then use your phone as you go to Sierra from the website saying that you're not allowed to scrap the website anymore.
14:44:000635:000635_2 : 14:43:26:116: So you then have to see if you just got a temporary block or you need to see if you if it's just your company or trying to fetch or you're just tried to find a workaround or something like that so yes group feedback in nitrate and then putting the pieces together you now have a meaningful you have meaningful information now lets a user or this questions and for every questions . 2
14:44:000636:000636_3 : 14:43:49:225: The time it is taken to execute the language is returning old is metadata is not connecting after you break it down script separately and then put it together . 3
14:44:000637:000637_4 : 14:44:01:366: So now you have the data you need To make the visualisations are the NRA so she would like to do for example business it can be used to predict things like that so can you have a you have 10 lines of Python let's see you need to see if any of the combination of lines can be replaced by a function in Wales in some libraries Les you're using a sorting function which oil which is already there in Python to sort . 4
14:45:000638:000638_1 : 14:44:26:492: So if someone is writing the code for bubble sort out some sorting and get your code should be able to predict and the pea chunk of code which is doing that so busy that it would be an excellent training set for those kind of France right you can go on to be visualisations and predictions so yeah . 1
14:45:000639:000639_2 : 14:44:49:641: A small tip something which I find very useful when I'm doing web scraping so this is basically simply using multi processing and this is like so basically this this is he likes of course which you need to know and I to make your script functions by Lily . 2
14:45:000640:000640_3 : 14:45:09:771: ELO Billy Joel My Life assessing and this is so you just have a list of you are those which you need to scrape and then you have a function which makes a browser request and get you the information you require this is simply the function and a list of . 3
14:45:000641:000641_0 : 14:45:24:921: Different processes but it depends on your computer or the server you are using to scream because there is something called of global. I don't remember yes . 4
14:45:000642:000642_1 : 14:45:37:070: Is a battle bot fighting against this is . 1
14:46:000643:000643_2 : 14:45:42:209: Discord might actually help me a lot when I was doing any scraping exercice . 2
14:46:000644:000644_3 : 14:45:48:351: Let me know when are the next late I've been there a few practices which we usually call ethical practices by me do not overload the service like I could have always . 3
14:46:000645:000645_1 : 14:46:00:486: A million requests a second by using GPUs a service but that actually damage the website in a few cases so you should not be very aggressive try to keep it keep the limits very low so that the functionality of the site is not disturb and yes I mean I usually use of your data such as like use Instax they're really basically this is just to organise you Connection in the between you have a backup and stuff like that when is an aggressive hits . 1
14:47:000646:000646_2 : 14:46:32:285: Also that the one thing which was really handy was using no sequel databases like I use mongodb to store all the data scrape because when I'm scraping the data I don't know what I might be needing in the future let's I'm just writing a script to get all user ratings but now I find ok if I had the country of the user . 2
14:47:000647:000647_0 : 14:46:55:421: Leave my nose is so in that case if you just have to have already died on d mannose equally as you don't need to organise a such as I so for those who know don't know about no sequelitis they do not have a predefined schema like you have to have an idea then our users and then I using it you can just dump any type of
14:47:000648:000648_4 : 14:47:19:533: Because scraping needs a dynamic like for example if you're breaking it down all the trees it wouldn't have the same schema if you need SQL you'll have to make 3 different databases and then join them again so it's so I usually use to . 4
14:48:000649:000649_1 : 14:47:39:645: I just dump everything and then after I have already tried this tried to clean the redial make sense of I mean I just tried to excite all the features that require . 1
14:48:000650:000650_2 : 14:47:50:463: So I think that is it from my side I'll be really happy to take a few questions if you have some time thank you . 2
14:48:000651:000651_4 : 14:48:08:548: Yorkshire . 4
14:48:000652:000652_1 : 14:48:12:674: So it is question is how do you find out how friendly are website is for sleeping late how many quests can you make in a minute so it's usually . 1
14:49:000653:000653_2 : 14:48:33:813: Keep the car running and your if your blood after a minute or a few minutes see you do it again let's say you repeat the exercise multiple times just see I usually use 50 requested which is kind of safe and not very slow but it depends on the website . 2
14:51:000654:000654_3 : 14:48:50:954: When actually me Liverpool missions to scrape the website so that there's no issue by the US open the website but you can keep . 3
14:56:000655:000655_4 : 14:49:03:082: Ok thank you thank you so much thank you . 4


DIY guide to convert Speech-to-text with DeepSpeech AND Text-to-speech with WaveNet Kajal Puri
 
 
15:09:000668:000668_2 : 15:07:15:581: I'm Kajal Puri I am doing Masters of computer science at university of Grenoble alpes in France I have to join my masters after completing one year as a data scientist at fractal Analytics Bangalore India and today I am going to talk about speech recognition I'm very a little bit about it so these are my social media handles in case you want to reach out. 2
15:10:000669:000669_0 : 15:09:09:745: So basically I start from the speech recognition basic definition. So in day to day life of just like the Vision or language are most important part of human life is voice or speech or speech recognition is a when a computer can't detect whatever are you have said in whatever language you have said in whatever expressions you have said I delete it anyway should be able to . 3
15:10:000670:000670_4 : 15:09:42:863: wear when you have said accurately into the form of text so that speech recognition and it's applications are very general in like the form of automatic captions generated captions on YouTube or not on YouTube anymore I guess this is the perfect example of automatic captions so yeah II is the voicemail transcription it or used to exist probably like 5 to 6 years back and it was very . 4
15:11:000671:000671_1 : 15:10:16:003: These days, obviously, its accuracy has increased but because of all the internet revolution, the telephone companies telecom companies have stopped using that, are the tide application that is very widely used as Siri Cortana and Google home etc like or you can give instruction or to your Google Mini that you not switch on the lights and it'll probably interpret I . 1
15:11:000672:000672_0 : 15:10:45:135: If it's not even doing to bed it'll probably Google search for you and dictate the results of so these are some basic applications on. This particular diagram shows you the high level interpretation of how speech recognition systems work so what happens is generally whenever I hear a sentence of each word syllable or has a particular soundwave associated to it . 2
15:11:000673:000673_3 : 15:10:46:135: You did to it so whenever even when you're saying I'm hello sequence of sound waves will be generated which will then be detected by neural networks and of . 3
15:12:000674:000674_4 : 15:11:29:486: We are using many algorithms, like pattern recognition or deep learning algorithms you can identify or you can match that particular sound wave to the word or syllable order sentence and then you can predict what the . 4
15:12:000675:000675_0 : 15:11:47:633: Soundwave was. like in this case the soundwave was hello then when we pass it to the neural network after a lot of people singing background of matching I predict says "hello". So, generally the word here is very predictable so it is predicted accurately but when we are seeing a lot of words or sentences put together in a
15:12:000676:000676_2 : 15:12:16:787: just like this one . 2
15:13:000677:000677_3 : 15:12:18:903: So basically, ASR, basicaly this how ASR systems work of fast is the speed segment extraction so what happens is that when of when we are speaking we are not speaking a word or syllable when speaking in a continuous of chain of sentences of word and a housing deleted done is that you're a model or your job during the processing face of . 3
15:13:000678:000678_0 : 15:12:51:051: Each sentence will be segmented in different words, so let's say you have of you have acted a sentence that I am at Pyton conference so how computer will integrate is that it will segmented do I am at and bake on translate the segmentation can vary but yeah. Are little segment or your whole speech or the whole of what you have sentence. . 4
15:14:000679:000679_0 : 15:13:18:236: I think our techniques can be applied only to refine it. Let's say that when you are saying this in a public of public place and there will be a lot of background noise so you can you find it more or so that the background noise is lesser or you can enhance the quality of the sound to this these are there are a lot more steps that you can do in the signal or speech preprocessoring part . 1
15:14:000680:000680_0 : 15:13:46:352: And then there are two ways basically or to do the modelling so when is that you can already use the vector embeddings that are already available on the internet or the second is that you can train your own model as well. So if you are already using the of between vectors of a model then or what you can do if you can just take the input sample offer of audio files and you can apply. 2
15:15:000681:000681_0 : 15:14:16:477: Statistical matching techniques on it and probably will be able to get the answers so please answer in the centre prediction of whatever or you have a 3rd and the second is that you feel first get the training data and then train your own model are you can probably use any of Architecture. There on the internet are you can actually customise that. it takes a lot of time . 3
15:15:000682:000682_4 : 15:14:17:477: But in some cases it's totally worth it then after training and pattern matching you can get the output so yeah that make you can see it there . 4
15:15:000683:000683_1 : 15:14:56:256: So what are the challenges of ASR so the first challenge is as old is the human accent that we can see here as well if you would have noticed that in this system whenever I click click in the world we all have we all come from different worlds and human accent is a very of integral part of us so generally what happens is that the data set of . 1
15:16:000684:000684_2 : 15:15:28:390: Internet . 2
15:16:000685:000685_3 : 15:15:30:513: That is probably the American on British native speakers so that's why there is a lot of bias in the data said that is freely available already so that is why I love Siri will be able to detect or what an American has said much more accurately than what a French or an Indian person would be saying to it so that's a really big problem officer . 3
15:16:000686:000686_4 : 15:15:58:684: You can I just say something out a human cannot be a robot so that's why every human will have its own unique or boys or accent which is generally ignored by an system so that's a big problem that people are working on it . 4
15:16:000688:000688_2 : 15:16:15:811: Hm I want to show you a quick demo of what it looks like. 2
15:16:000689:000689_0 : 15:16:21:955: I will probably show it in the end, so that we don't have any technical difficulties so they're taking our problem off ASR is the background noise so are in an ideal situation he will be sitting in a room and saying something to Siri but that's not always going to be the case because you can be travelling or you can be in a
15:17:000690:000690_4 : 15:16:48:122: Most of . 4
15:17:000691:000691_1 : 15:16:51:259: Most of the data sets that are available on internet are very ideal, they do not have any background noise so you don't need much redefining but in a real-time it's a problem because whenever you are speaking you will have a little bit of most of the time they will have a little bit of background noise so sometimes it interferes and the system is not able to predicted correctly so . 1
15:18:000692:000692_2 : 15:17:16:397: This diagram shows the intersection of accent and of background noise and you can see that the most the most word error rate is when there is an Indian native speaker and it has a lot of backg finish which is pretty obvious . 2
15:18:000694:000694_3 : 15:17:38:374: Round noise Yeah so are the third is the misinterpretation of homophones so homophones are the words that sound exactly the same sound that might have different spellings as well but they have different meanings are the meaning of is different at different parts of so the perfect example if "We have won the match" and it can easily be predicted by any other system is we have won the match which door . 3
15:18:000695:000695_4 : 15:18:06:555: All of me totally changes the meaning of the sentence and there are a few number of more example so what happens if I probably will not Fade Like it's not the correct structure "we went to see the sea but in the human . 4
15:18:000696:000696_1 : 15:18:25:680: Can you also like you often see sentences that are not maybe English . 1
15:18:000697:000697_2 : 15:18:32:823: In the structure but that is used of very much in the conversation so these are the sum of points that will be used in the conversation and that you can actually tell Siri to do something but . 2
15:19:000698:000698_3 : 15:18:48:964: you can say that there may be grammatically or structurally not very English Direct so yeah . 3
15:19:000699:000699_4 : 15:18:56:116: Phoebe always or most of the time misinteprets homophones, so that is a problem that as I'd has 2 of a cup of tea I should not be having because in the league humans understand what we are trying to say . 4
15:20:000700:000700_1 : 15:19:13:259: So the fourth point is the overlapping sounds so what happens is that when humans are talking sometimes lots of different people are talking at the same time and still we are able to differentiate who is speaking but ASR is not able to answer one of the reason is the . 1
15:20:000701:000701_2 : 15:19:40:405: of the reason is the . 2
15:20:000702:000702_3 : 15:19:41:405: Unavailability of l the data sets are single speaker and single stream available and there is no overlapping and sometimes there are no multiple speakers so that's why it's strained or on such type of data sets and it gives0 results . 3
15:20:000704:000704_4 : 15:20:03:706: You should be able to a segment of of between the two personalities and who is trying to say what . 4
15:21:000705:000705_1 : 15:20:13:709: There are other minor problem in as ASR as weel the of waiting and my mentality that you are giving an instruction to an AI system and you're working from your home to outside so I probably in your home you will not have much noisy sounds but when you go outside you will probably have a noisy background and sometimes because of the genes in a little bit of in . 1
15:21:000706:000706_0 : 15:20:45:869: Yes I do feel it should not be the case ideally. The second is a very important part which is the artefact from the hard way to some be even these days your phones are not supposed to get the offer quality of whatever you were saying azan in the audio and because of the quality of the as I might not be able to detect the current sound waves and it might not understand what you're . 2
15:22:000707:000707_3 : 15:21:19:986: Are the top of the town is the audio and compression artefact this nearly happens not in the real time but let's say you're trying to transcript or . 3
15:22:000708:000708_4 : 15:21:35:131: Transcription system so I can be a good example of feedback when you have heard the whole ordeal and when you're trying to compress it then the quality of the audio can be lost there are many other factors as well like the age of the Speaker of a child have a different kind of . 4
15:22:000709:000709_1 : 15:21:36:131: Colander pronunciation of words or from Android 8 speaker . 1
15:22:000710:000710_2 : 15:22:03:477: What's the most important Factor days or high competition tools necessary so . 2
15:22:000711:000711_3 : 15:22:11:495: To convert a speech into a text requires a lot of . 3
15:23:000712:000712_4 : 15:22:17:631: Is a lot of processing preprocessing and save you will need high or am only be as well the data storage so that the issue in the ASR . 4
15:23:000713:000713_1 : 15:22:31:609: What is the need of a ASR so nowadays we know that there are going to be self-driving cars maybe after some time so the one thing is that of the can help you begin help you like in multitasking so let's say that when you are driving you can actually call system and your card that you know if you should turn on the light source which on Lake switch the temperature . 1
15:23:000714:000714_2 : 15:23:03:729: On air conditionning in you Car and much more stuff like that I'm taking this born for people with disabilities so take 10/:/ off right now human population is not is disabled in some way d and another for this is a boon for them that they don't have to use . 2
15:24:000715:000715_3 : 15:23:24:862: They don't have to use the lake fingers on hand in some way and only then . 3
15:24:000716:000716_4 : 15:23:32:996: They don't have to use the lake fingers on Understand them at all this can be used both my literate and illiterate which it is obvious I even a person who is not properly educating channel is communicate and the language so it will be very easy for them to give an instruction or ask a question to the automatic speech recognition system and they'll get the answer back or forward to very important point as a social perspective is that . 4
15:25:000717:000717_1 : 15:24:04:183: Languages in the world that are on the verge of extinction so let's say that you have a letter that Google has already released and yes a system which can understand a particular language and AJ language and then the people of those groups can actually or use it and they can help it to prevent or prevent the Extinction of that language and preserve it as it can be . 1
15:25:000718:000718_2 : 15:24:05:183: Taught to many people. 2
15:26:000719:000719_3 : 15:24:40:529:Speeding things instruction so this is also very important part because when you are trying to write to text or using some other way of communication it might be a little less faster than what the human speech can do so like you these days you don't even need a place you can just talk to your phone and probably your work will be done . 3
15:26:000720:000720_4 : 15:25:09:411: So are these are the three basic types of ASR the first is the template-based so it's it has been actually outdated so what happens in this case is you already have a set of template and if the person is trying to communicate with you then you can match the communication of that person with a particular template and if it does not match then you can sing . 4
15:26:000721:000721_0 : 15:25:10:511: To the person that the question answer that you're looking for is not in our system the second is the knowledge or rule-based this is applied in most of the IVR system that we called customer service and all they have a pre-order find a rules and if this if your question is out of the rules you cannot really communicate with them. so and you have a special a human that is employed the . 1
15:27:000722:000722_0 : 15:26:09:770: That is the second. And the third is statistical approach which is used most commonly these days and this is based on data Science particularly because you have to collect a lot of the time training it on a particular deep learning architecture then you apply a lot of pattern recognition or matching a statistical approaches and then you can get your result . 2
15:27:000723:000723_0 : 15:26:33:701: So like now how it can be done so there are two ways to do it one is to either program of model by yourself and the second is to use an existing API are the few apis that I have tasted so are the best API is the Google speech API but the problem is that it takes a lot of money to pay because I think after a up 2000 they are not free
15:28:000724:000724_4 : 15:27:06:830: so that can be a Big Challenge for students are for research purposes because you don't have that much of funds to invest there are fewer so basically the APIs also have different features and the IBM the IBM Watson API does not give you a very customised door with you as much as Google or Microsoft can I do for you and also in these apis you can Select Your Language season select different language . 4
15:28:000725:000725_1 : 15:27:37:995: Cancel a different of the frequency of different words that are spoken of these are the few features how deep speech is one of the most Heelys open source library which converts speech to text and it's based on the Baidu research paper and it is also implemented in Python and tensorflow . 1
15:29:000726:000726_2 : 15:28:00:009: So basically as a developer I have used deep speech and the reason is as follows First the development of these features totally open-source like you can quickly you can contribute are you can actually take the code of what are the features that are behind those functions ET secondaires Hypervenom metre tuning of modern so you can see them which type O . 2
15:29:000727:000727_3 : 15:28:30:156: Mini implemented and you can actually play with the hyperparameters according to the according to the task you need or the kind of dataset you have a tortoise cost effective because of its open source of nature are 4th is batch processing so a lot of APIs like Microsoft and Google they do not provide the service which is to batch process and check how much time or how much . 3
15:29:000728:000728_0 : 15:28:57:311: Alphabetical a badge of your data safe this is giving you can train your own model from scratch this is generally very expensive but in case if you have resources you can do it and I think this will be worth it if you have a really good data set or distributed training is also not done their pre-trained models so let's see that in case
15:31:000729:000729_1 : 15:29:24:501: Can you just want to get the already train embeddings and you just want to do use it on your data sets that you can do with it as well and it gives better results in general or with the real-time speech data which is really the problems we are working on to build and ideally I so this is the result comparison off all the apis . 1
15:31:000730:000730_2 : 15:29:51:627: The comparison is John and generally down on first between dataset and then the Noisy datasets so as to know if your model is not overfeed by a particular data set or it works equally well on a real-time human or data set . 2
15:31:000731:000731_4 : 15:30:57:924: You can a person doesn't know who is human and who is any of your system so it can easily distinguish who is an virtual assistant . 4
15:32:000732:000732_0 : 15:31:09:080: What they're trying to do is there trying to put more number of emotions and to make it sound more like humans that you're not able to distinguish if I like the who who was talking to you on the phone and this was probably the yeah this was demonstrated on the Google IO 2018 as well by Sundar Pichai so the major two parameters
15:32:000733:000733_2 : 15:31:36:260: No text to speech intelligibility and how humanely it sounds so intelligibility is generally a hardware or of the background problem it's like the quality of audio how clear it is and whether it's listenable or not which are not that tough to achieve them or at ufford Park is how Human League sounds so emotions the timing at the structure of sentences and as well the prononciation . 2
15:32:000734:000734_0 : 15:32:07:384: For these are the human features that are really from every other human 2 others so it's not just basically if you want an AI to sound like yourself you must they must know you how you speak and how you deliver your sentences are what kind of pronunciation you have. This is a problem that they are working on . 3
15:32:000735:000735_1 : 15:32:33:563: To solve this problem there are two architectures that are really popular these days when is the wavelength and second is the simple rnn so the wavelength of . 1
15:33:000736:000736_2 : 15:32:47:682: Picture is generally a . 2
15:33:000737:000737_0 : 15:32:51:831: They both models generator raw audio model this is an autoregressive generative models also what it
15:34:000738:000738_0 : 15:33:05:962: Is a speech is a sequence of audio signals and audio decoder recurrent neural networks are designed to do that. But it uses a convolutional neural networks instead and of today are not exactly the convolution neural networks by dilated in a way that they can order take the video sequences and of get the minimum sample of an audio and then they apply various pattern recognition algorithm . 4
15:34:000739:000739_1 : 15:33:40:034: So what the experiment washuman done on that it was trained on the human data and the output produced was just like human that it was able to do is able to detect the emotions the sounds that humans produce but it was not able to detect the right kind of text structure of saw it it was is blubbering and in one way or another . 1
15:34:000740:000740_0 : 15:34:11:162: The good and bad thing of this is that it takes 4 minutes to generate one second of audio .Some people that say that it's lesser for a start and some people say that it's really good for a start. To Fall Live ill have to look out for more research papers and I think down the line they will lakes are nearly listen to probably one minute or 30 seconds so let's see what is . 2
15:35:000741:000741_3 : 15:34:38:306: To be in future so this is the sort of evening which is not the usual convolution of the neural networks so this is the dilated convolution neural network which was just discovered to accomplish this task . 3
15:35:000742:000742_4 : 15:34:56:424: So this is the second type of architecture, this is Sample-RNN which is not explored much of to live up to the date of it is also used to generate the audio samples so what happens if that multiple are innings I finished it in a particular sequence and the audio is given to the top layer of the recurrent neural network and it gets Empire until it's at its . 4
15:36:000743:000743_1 : 15:35:25:569: Sample of to the last layer of the Architecture of so it is computationally 500 times faster but it does not give that much of good results as wavenet and . 1
15:36:000744:000744_0 : 15:35:41:688: But not that good stale so not much can be said about it because it has not been experimented. So if somebody a man who is looking to experiment with text to speech she can barely explored this idea more because . 2
15:36:000745:000745_3 : 15:35:58:833: Hazardous is architecture of simple rnn Deezer the slide actually that I just . 3
15:36:000746:000746_4 : 15:36:06:953: By attending the few tasks in the morning so this picture is the transcription generated by this module by an Indian speaker and you can do it so the deadlines are there soda read about sentences are probably the only totally not in the . 4
15:36:000747:000747_1 : 15:36:28:080: Early night in the . 1
15:36:000748:000748_2 : 15:36:31:215: Totally contrasting . 2
15:36:000749:000749_3 : 15:36:36:381: They don't ot at all with the things that the person was trying to or speak or interpret . 3
15:37:000750:000750_0 : 15:36:37:381: Totally match
15:37:000751:000751_4 : 15:36:47:510: If these are the things that was . 4
15:37:000752:000752_1 : 15:36:52:621: Spoken by a guy who has a very good English accent as compared to the another so it doesn't make sense of completely but I think it has still listen I'm off out of the box character of Ord so I think this is a very live demonstration of yourself . 1
15:38:000753:000753_2 : 15:37:14:686: For these are the references that I have included in this my diagrams and the results were taken from these resources and this is my email ID in case you have a question . 2
15:38:000754:000754_0 : 15:37:30:501: Snow so deep speech angry evening actor so basically this question is about how is wavenet is used in deep speech so deep speech is for now use just for the speech to text generation that is if you're speaking a text and accurate text should be generated. Whereas the Void wavenet is doing the opposite of converting a text to the speech . 3
15:38:000755:000755_4 : 15:38:17:638: Yeah so basically deep state deep speech has more votes are fighting as well as tensorflow implementation so . 4

15:39:000759:000759_4 : 15:38:47:209: Yeah so this is one article difference that I have taken . 4
15:39:000760:000760_1 : 15:38:55:901: Ok so I just added as a resource in her of the sample code that I have tried I just added her or you can just bring me on my email and I'll send it to your voice now . 1
15:40:000761:000761_2 : 15:39:11:461: Oh yes you think I'm good thanks for reminding me . 2
15:40:000762:000762_1 : 15:39:36:680: Ok . 1

15:51:000766:000766_2 : 15:47:00:364: I know I haven't actually tried on any other model of deep sleep is the only one that was available as a free open-source and that is what we were looking at that time so there might be some place Google or Microsoft API for that but I haven't tried time so I cannot see me . 2

16:32:000032:000032_2 : 16:30:58:013: First of all I would like to start with some words of Andrew NG he's like number one number to nowadays in deep learning he has great courses they are in call Sarah and he says that artificial intelligence is the new electricity key saying that the changes that we've seen 100 years ago regarding or regarding electricity are going to be back again with artificial intelligence . 2
16:33:000033:000033_3 : 16:31:26:173: What's the phone I would like to start with some words of Andrew NG he's like number one number to nowadays in deep learning he has great courses they are in call Sarah and he says that artificial intelligence is the new electricity key saying that the changes that we've seen 100 years ago regarding or regarding electricity are Just seen the start of the wave so the our lives 100 years with this Revolution coming coming to us . 3
16:33:000034:000034_4 : 16:31:36:412: I will make a little introduction about image classification and image segmentation Towers in stocks information that is the perfect . 4
16:33:000035:000035_0 : 16:32:53:517: IMage classification. We have images and we have the label of each of those samples of this of those images like the class in this case we have two classes cats and dogs are we have a lot of images of cats and dogs live so we feed them over into that we feed the moment with those images and after a lot of iterations and going back and forward you will be able to . 3
16:34:000036:000036_4 : 16:33:21:662: Release new images that we are not in the data set with train with and waste I will get a result this case if we insert a cat will get a cat as a report that's the main idea image classification one object per image . 4
16:34:000037:000037_1 : 16:33:39:809: So here's dad life is kind of more difficult than that it's like me saying the problem is like taking only one object . 1
16:35:000038:000038_2 : 16:33:50:964: So we have a bunch of more difficult problems that computer vision specialist are dealing with the first one classification the one I've been talking about someone is classification of localization so that means adding a bounding box into each of the object in this case only one so it's kind of easy in some way we have one object with tag where it is and we say what it is . 2
16:35:000039:000039_0 : 16:34:19:145: Bounding box and detecting more than one object music image example we might see two cats one dog and something that looks like a duck but it's plastic. So it's so that's not a dog we can do they know that that subject lead Edge detection put in a bounding box into each of the object . 3
16:35:000040:000040_4 : 16:34:44:540: And the most difficult than the one we use here is adding a mask into the image and detecting exactly where the object if you can see sorry if I pass the camera . 4
16:35:000041:000041_1 : 16:35:00:701: Pixels that are shared between different objects and that's not a problem for the other team you could detect that one pixel will be part of different objects that the idea . 1
16:35:000042:000042_2 : 16:35:13:861: We are going forward . 2
16:35:000043:000043_3 : 16:35:16:792: We're going to see some demos . 3
16:35:000044:000044_4 : 16:35:19:943: Used in different types of models of all the four different problems that are you sure . 4
16:35:000045:000045_1 : 16:35:26:511: The use yolo to. 1
16:36:000046:000046_2 : 16:35:29:748: See what you are the cards that we are dealing so you imagined using this in Vegas ok . 2
16:36:000047:000047_3 : 16:35:40:138: Let's go back to show the cards I need to take to accept which is the number that they are using . 3
16:36:000048:000048_4 : 16:35:49:280: BBC biggest could be a little illegal made me but it would be really good for a machine to pay with you you'll understand when two player to win two player 7 those kind of problems . 4
16:36:000049:000049_1 : 16:36:03:306: Taken this is a problem that a lot of medical people have been serving trying to deal with 3D images with 2D images . 1
16:36:000050:000050_2 : 16:36:16:513: This is Radiography of heart . 2
16:36:000051:000051_3 : 16:36:20:660: Real time . 3
16:37:000052:000052_4 : 16:36:23:821: the idea is to detect where the heart is and where are they part of the heart are and create a 3D image of that with that in mind we could go forward and you take if there's any disease. 4
16:37:000053:000053_1 : 16:36:38:973: Inside the inside heart or any issues that use a very deep convolutional neural for that I'm not going to spend it now but the idea is that with this type of networks we can deal with this kind of networds we can deal with very difficult problems . 1
16:37:000054:000054_2 : 16:36:53:937: No problem . 2
16:37:000055:000055_3 : 16:36:57:100: If dealing with emotions you can have a camera with a man and he will say if he's happy if you had to regret it if he's angry abNout something only seen the emotions of that person if we move forward there more interesting and we are surprised it's pretty awesome what you can do . 3
16:38:000056:000056_0 : 16:37:25:076: So this
16:38:000057:000057_1 : 16:37:32:221: We use Neural networks on this site here we are and we want to understand a bit more about how they work why are there so cool why they work so well what is the secret behind them . 1
16:38:000058:000058_2 : 16:37:46:357: And the most basic idea is that we have inputs we have wait for those inputs with some them with button activation function and we say yes or no to those simple simple simple idea that we need to understand the perceptron that perceptron is multiplier of time but the main idea is that we try to generalize a feature in that never run then there will . 2
16:38:000059:000059_3 : 16:38:15:468: Identify specific feature . 3
16:39:000060:000060_4 : 16:38:19:635: And if we multiply a lot of time each of those narrow it's a perceptron we have a lot of features and they never will be able to understand different features to solve a problem with my visa card not a got it might be it said 2 or a 7 in in in the cards . 4
16:39:000061:000061_1 : 16:38:42:776: But that sort of problems are kind of easy if you have five six different inputs . 1
16:39:000062:000062_2 : 16:38:51:916: To deal with the calling all my information and that's where a composition another network or comments come dat . 2
16:40:000063:000063_3 : 16:39:03:953: I need to be the way that we were working . 3
16:40:000064:000064_4 : 16:39:08:106: Before deep learning, We have the images we hired we selected we deal with it specialist of future extractions of those images we generated tons of different kpis or key performance indicators in order to fit the model and then to detect if it's a car off another car like in this problem only change this idea he tries to get into the model of the feature extraction and live them all optimised in . 4
16:40:000065:000065_1 : 16:39:41:254: How will they get into a car or no car decision that sorted everything into the mall everything to the most the side and optimises iterate that have good times until we get to a really good solution . 1
16:40:000066:000066_2 : 16:39:59:643: Parts of the Goblet really quickly . 2
16:40:000067:000067_3 : 16:40:03:808: The idea of the convolutional layer is that we have filter that's if it says it's in the middle of the of the two layers . 3
16:40:000068:000068_4 : 16:40:15:957: Picture . 4
16:41:000069:000069_1 : 16:40:18:109: Activated where the filter . 1
16:41:000070:000070_2 : 16:40:21:638: Play Imagine we have a filter that will activate a specifically where the corners are so it will be in the output layer the one in blue it will be in higher numbers where the filter gets activated and in Lower numbers for the filter doesn't get activated that's the idea . 2
16:41:000071:000071_3 : 16:40:41:980: To reduce the dimensionality of the outputs of those layers and you know that to be able to delete that in GPUs and CPUs and also to be able to after feet fully convolutional layer the promise that we can feel all the information into the fully convolutional layer when it's 3:02 layers to reduce the dimensionality . 3
16:41:000072:000072_4 : 16:41:06:318: You can see we select the max of each of the different goals in the first light blue with a 7 because it's the max of those values same for the 9 and for the 8 and the 5 there are there putting layers but in this article is also . 4
16:42:000073:000073_1 : 16:41:26:470: In the last layer . 1
16:42:000074:000074_2 : 16:41:31:619: Soft max layert is really similar to the fully connected layer but we are very big difference in terms of probabilities . 2
16:42:000075:000075_3 : 16:41:42:782: The idea in deep learning is to select the model are the result has a better probability in this case we have different images we will select the one with bigger probability that would be green . 3
16:42:000076:000076_4 : 16:41:58:912: Natural not cat cat or dog in select the dog because I need you show me the last layer of work . 4
16:43:000077:000077_1 : 16:42:07:763: We had nonlinearities as well because if not it's all over time we will you multiply matrices and adding on the artist has shown . 1
16:43:000078:000078_2 : 16:42:19:920: Old cinema Network radio was introduced by Alex netting 2012 . 2
16:43:000080:000080_2 : 16:43:02:954: The loss function comparing the reality of the data that we have with the output of the network so they did minimize the loss function as much as we can and to do that need an hour instead they used to be but nowadays they moved to other type of momentum and second grade momentum are the uses call Adam and it's pretty good now that use . 2
16:44:000081:000081_3 : 16:43:36:110: More . 3
16:44:000082:000082_4 : 16:43:39:279: Adam is pretty pretty good . 4
16:44:000083:000083_1 : 16:43:43:934: Sometimes we do with problems of overfitting there are two ways that I used to register with fitting in this project we drop out there to eliminate some neurones with a probability maybe in iteration number 11 we have enabled like this . 1
16:44:000084:000084_2 : 16:44:05:083: And maybe in iteration 12 this one doesn't get activated but this one . 2
16:44:000085:000085_3 : 16:44:10:866: This and this one it is so it changes every iteration barrier to make the network understand that teachers should be learning different parts not only in the same part . 3
16:44:000086:000086_4 : 16:44:24:978: Will be mixing this information every time and in mixing, and in mixing a situation that will be better for the learning of the model . 4
16:45:000087:000087_1 : 16:44:35:949: That we used in this project also is called data augmentation . 1
16:45:000088:000088_0 : 16:44:43:097: Useful when you had won't have a lot of samples for each class
16:45:000089:000089_3 : 16:44:49:245: That's not very good for deep learning so very intelligent people developed a way to generate more images through the same images of we have you can get the decorator decorated engaged d h and with the same images will have more and that would make your mother you're better and get to better accuracy levels . 3
16:45:000090:000090_4 : 16:45:12:378: That's pretty good that's pretty awesome but it's only for one object per image how do we deal with different objects in the same image and different boxes and all the stuff that's going on nowadays . 4
16:45:000091:000091_1 : 16:45:30:295: What's call regional convolutional neural network . 1
16:46:000092:000092_2 : 16:45:36:451: Which with different objects . 2
16:46:000093:000093_3 : 16:45:40:174: Radius to generate a lot of bounding boxes in the middle there call proposal preparation and for each of them we imported into a moto . 3
16:46:000094:000094_4 : 16:45:53:550: Will we have a class and a new class that is no object by we have all the remaining classes so we might have different results for the same image we have a person but also maybe we have a horse ok . 4
16:46:000095:000095_1 : 16:46:08:704: The problem with this algorithm is that is very slow imagine having to prepare for only one iteration take part in a full bottle of wine image imagine for 2008 is pretty slow but it's a pretty good idea . 1
16:46:000096:000096_2 : 16:46:26:359: Let's move to selected search in order to generate 2000 regional 2000 boxes . 2
16:47:000097:000097_3 : 16:46:37:516: Do you . 3
16:47:000098:000098_4 : 16:46:39:658: Search that generates . 4
16:47:000099:000099_1 : 16:46:44:813: Neighbours in pixels and then they attach them one into another and today get to the number 2000 and if you . 1
16:47:000100:000100_2 : 16:46:56:779: They use a CNN for his proposal they fix the size to 227 to 237 . 2
16:47:000101:000101_3 : 16:47:05:121: Into a 4096 . 3
16:47:000102:000102_4 : 16:47:09:299: features that would be the output . 4
16:47:000103:000103_1 : 16:47:13:074: It would be the last layer until the output output usually say what you see message it's usually a 1000 classes and then they use ssbm to detect which is the actual class of the . 1
16:47:000104:000104_2 : 16:47:28:207: Image . 2
16:47:000105:000105_3 : 16:47:30:664: Weather . 3
16:48:000106:000106_0 : 16:47:32:807: Interest we wrapped. Images which generate one pass for each of that image ratios . 4
16:48:000107:000107_1 : 16:47:42:960: The class and we also have for my used for the bouding box that is very interesting because they are in this part . 1
16:48:000108:000108_4 : 16:47:53:094: Will be 1.4 each of the points of the of depression so now instead of having Only One e mess we have five the four points for each of the corners of the image and the class . 2
16:48:000109:000109_3 : 16:48:08:256: Well try to solve the issues dad is Arsene and had . 3
16:48:000110:000110_4 : 16:48:17:404: Meaning came and decided to include something alright perception . 4
16:49:000111:000111_0 : 16:48:24:203: To improve this problem of Speed. that R-cnn had . 1
16:49:000112:000112_2 : 16:48:32:080: Set of passing the . 2
16:49:000113:000113_3 : 16:48:36:235: This is a 4 bus 2000 times bigger Radio 1 competition their work and the pattern only one time and generated One future map that will have all the regions the region of interest to the pulling layer that solve the issue of Speed . 3
16:49:000114:000114_1 : 16:49:00:425: Really fast it was a one hour one of the best I going to see this one a lot of competition and it was their state-of-the-art in the year 2014 . 1
16:49:000115:000115_2 : 16:49:12:387: It had some issues let's see a little bit about how they did it . 2
16:49:000116:000116_3 : 16:49:18:906: Leia uses the max pooling to combat a futures . 3
16:50:000117:000117_0 : 16:49:25:421: Into a small Peter map but this this is a map is configurable is H . W
16:50:000118:000118_1 : 16:49:26:421: But my weight you should you say configurable, usually 7 by 7 . 1
16:50:000119:000119_2 : 16:49:38:324: And the idea of this is to train all of the network with onepass before in our CNN we have three different parts and those three parts wear trendy friendly the Revolution with fast rcnn came with the idea of training the same network with one with the tax laws and all from the start to the end without any stocks . 2
16:50:000120:000120_3 : 16:50:04:484: H set with the same weight and the same as using the theory of evolution the market and the day of the image recognition and computer vision people . 3
16:50:000121:000121_4 : 16:50:18:651: After that what's another . 4
16:51:000123:000123_1 : 16:50:22:781: Ther CNN what's a little better . 1
16:51:000124:000124_2 : 16:50:26:580: Improve the bounding box II Russian . 2
16:51:000125:000125_3 : 16:50:30:905: Being the way that they generated the convolution for the National proposal network that's an invention of them they generated a network to generate the proposal instead of dealing with layer of the convolutional network generating a network and imported inside this multi multi proposal network . 3
16:52:000126:000126_4 : 16:51:04:045: The first will be the class and the second will be the box . 4
16:52:000127:000127_1 : 16:51:09:873: If object or not update use a simplified into the most basic stuff so that they will have to deal with that they rear box object or not objects super simple and then the idea of detecting which the objectives will be enough for the bus . 1
16:52:000128:000128_2 : 16:51:31:428: Andy are you something that is really interesting that some of the people that talk before and they they mention it the different and Conquer boxes so did you hear is that the centre of the object is Key that the center of the ocean is the key part of any of the object because of with that centre if you move different bounding box is one of them will be good one of them were . 2
16:52:000129:000129_3 : 16:51:59:582: Andy are you something that is really interesting that some of the people that talk before and they they mention it the different and Conquer boxes so did you hear is that the centre of the object is Key Centre of the ocean is the key part of any of the object because of with that centre if you move different bounding box is one of them will Glad you're looking for . 3
16:52:000130:000130_4 : 16:52:02:596: The monitor will can be configurable and you will have for each of the ankle boxes that you pass through the network it's 2K because it's 2 check or not object by 4K scores and also cake 4K because you have for . 4
16:52:000131:000131_1 : 16:52:23:055: The point that detect the anchor . 1
16:52:000132:000132_2 : 16:52:27:923: In faster CNN did they generated 9 anchor boxes so that you have a square and you have different rectangles of different sizes . 2
16:53:000133:000133_3 : 16:52:38:464: And I was I was talking before to be able to train the network in one pass . 3
16:53:000134:000134_0 : 16:52:47:620: Is the loss function then they use various. . 4
16:53:000135:000135_1 : 16:52:53:119: Turn off the glass of detecting the object class and detecting the object box will be mixed into one loss function and that looks functions will be wait so that the two parts were the same it's equally important to detect the class of the option of the object of the bounding box . 1
16:54:000136:000136_2 : 16:53:17:275: And after that we came to the model that we used is called mask rcnn . 2
16:54:000137:000137_3 : 16:53:23:980: And the cool thing is that it adds a third step detecting the mask pixel by pixel to know where the object is. 3
16:54:000138:000138_4 : 16:53:35:493: You have any questions whatsoever and now you can do it in french right now because it's I know it's kind of . 4
16:54:000139:000139_2 : 16:53:53:888: I will go further question what if the mask is part of the detection of it's another part completely different . 2
16:54:000140:000140_3 : 16:54:12:680: Why was saying that I . 3
16:54:000141:000141_4 : 16:54:16:822: Part of the box section there is no way now in my skin and I will I will explain how it works it's a third part completely different ok . 4
16:55:000142:000142_1 : 16:54:27:749: In the question is if it is done in the learning phase and suggest anything send an email on face and you getting face say yes to use images that are not part of the training set an exactly where the objects are . 1
16:55:000143:000143_2 : 16:54:46:905: Well this will be the Architecture of the model you have a regional reports on network as we had before him faster rcnn . 2

16:55:000145:000145_4 : 16:55:03:681: You detect the box but you detect the box in a little Square that is the approximation that they know what network gives to that box but then when you put it to the rear limited with the real size there was a little business alignment so right I'm hoping that way but I'll be saying more about that a later before the bounding box on the regulation class predictions simulator Factor . 4
16:56:000146:000146_1 : 16:55:33:841: And the odd the beanery mass production . 1
16:56:000147:000147_2 : 16:55:38:152: Prestige regional reports on network . 2
16:56:000148:000148_3 : 16:55:43:229: Media to extract a high-level features from the input image you will end up with a tennis order of size m n and c m n are configurable and they are usually odd numbers . 3
16:56:000149:000149_4 : 16:56:03:694: Number of kernael or features o that we use . 4
16:56:000150:000150_1 : 16:56:08:313: Play the original purpose of life a window for the image . 1
16:56:000151:000151_0 : 16:56:14:965: NY passing through the images he tries a
16:56:000152:000152_3 : 16:56:22:116: It's comfortable in our protocol use 15 . 3
16:56:000153:000153_4 : 16:56:27:425: What is an . 4
16:56:000154:000154_1 : 16:56:30:362: 7 Different anchor boxes . 1
16:57:000155:000155_2 : 16:56:33:141: So . 2
16:57:000156:000156_4 : 16:56:36:304: 4K because we have four points for each of the images and took a as before because we have two different types of objective it is an update or not and k because of the angle boxes . 4
16:57:000157:000157_1 : 16:56:51:033: This is Amer for the idea is that we sent to the object and we use of numbers to be able to sned so if M and n are not off we cannot we could never to have a centre will have something very difficult to calculate YP ankle boxes the idea is to have as much different types of boxes to take different types of objects I will ask them before they're too young for cake on . 1
16:57:000158:000158_2 : 16:57:23:188: Minnie Mouse a the love punch . 2
16:57:000159:000159_3 : 16:57:27:345: If you do a flat you could be configurable you could use a rest if you could you direct next . 3
16:57:000160:000160_4 : 16:57:35:003: Complex and more deep . 4
16:58:000161:000161_1 : 16:57:38:164: I will check with you say resnet in because of the restrictions that we had . 1
16:58:000162:000162_2 : 16:57:44:494: And this is something that implemented that is kind of . 2
16:58:000163:000163_3 : 16:57:50:241: Interesting to understand maybe you have images that are objects of different sizes you take a picture of a of a beach and you have a little people in the sea and you are very big people like in the picture so it shouldn't take the little people but it also will need to protect a big people that are in front of the camera so the idea is to generate predictions in different level of scale . 3
16:59:000164:000164_4 : 16:58:19:401: it Will use the same window for example a 3 by 3 sliding window but it was make different sizing of the image so the idea is that in the first layer of prediction. 4
16:59:000165:000165_1 : 16:58:36:375: It will get the bigger objects because the sliding Windows will be almost as big as the . 1
16:59:000166:000166_2 : 16:58:45:690: A subject but then when we move back the sliding window will be the same and hope you will be very bigger so it was activate when samller objects appear and not with the big objects appear . 2
16:59:000167:000167_3 : 16:58:59:839: And add someone into the other so we will take all of them not only one or the other . 3
16:59:000168:000168_4 : 16:59:08:872: That's why it is it is a pyramid . 4
17:00:000169:000169_1 : 16:59:13:884: After that comes the algorithm called RolAlign. 1
17:00:000170:000170_2 : 16:59:18:034: Play we had some problems when fixing the the boxing to the object various to use file in your interpret interpretation to sample in Boots and to get a better approximation of where the box should be this is letter explaining the paper of my CNN I don't know if I have much time to get into it but maybe I can explain a little bit a later date is it to generate point exactly where there is anything that . 2
17:00:000171:000171_3 : 16:59:50:166: The bounding box on the cat position prediction are pretty similar to the ones using faster rcnn her bounding box V Croatia that processes once for each corner of the bounding box and evaluate in the class of for the label set . 3
17:00:000172:000172_4 : 17:00:12:121: And after that we have the binary maths prediction the problem with the binary maths prediction is that will you show me resize the images into the input of the network but when will resize again we use a lot of that information sites in our sizing . 4
17:00:000173:000173_1 : 17:00:30:276: Sometimes it's really good and sentences that is what I'm good but it's a problem that is so then you're not another network a little bit further but it works reading mask rcnn so you can see that . 1
17:01:000174:000174_2 : 17:00:47:452: In this part . 2
17:01:000175:000175_3 : 17:00:50:614: Inside in rnn network on the final mask it's pretty good I need . 3
17:01:000176:000176_1 : 17:00:57:791: Go to the initial object . 1
17:01:000177:000177_2 : 17:01:02:105: And then I found so now instead of having to part with a 3 parts are in the mask and all of them some in the in the same as a function in the same way in the same proportion one thing to be clear about the mask only added when they detect the object correctly . 2
17:02:000178:000178_3 : 17:01:21:870: When he doesn't detect the ox correctly so if it says background with a mask it doesn't count in the loss function . 3
17:02:000179:000179_0 : 17:01:31:499: Well done to sum up still brand that out of the bath. I would stay object mask he changed their rightful from . 4
17:02:000180:000180_1 : 17:01:45:270: R-cnn to realign 2/:/ to preserve day except special locations they separate mask and cloth predictions and you have a new Look function with three parts . 1
17:02:000181:000181_2 : 17:01:59:028: Graphic America graphic of the mobile . 2
17:02:000182:000182_3 : 17:02:04:185: That gets to the Future Maps that will be the bounding boxes for the model and then you have two parts one for that deals with the mask and another part completely different than that was your question before 11 . 3
17:02:000183:000183_4 : 17:02:05:185: And the other one this with a regression and where the box is there a question saying the four values because they're numbers you should be a regression as a classification and the classification of the class . 4
17:02:000184:000184_1 : 17:02:33:438: Stampy Todds . 1
17:02:000185:000185_2 : 17:02:37:779: You can see that it works really good I'm going to lose weight . 2
17:03:000186:000186_3 : 17:02:44:929: Examples . 3
17:04:000188:000188_4 : 17:02:47:064: Disconnected object I need the disc the same object doesn't divided into 2 parts . 4
17:04:000189:000189_0 : 17:02:53:997: Does having sec a bit of time and he doesn't detect the shakes here are subject it's understand that. Not an object . 1
17:04:000190:000190_3 : 17:03:58:606: Included where the Lanes are when the village where and we have a mask so we came one image 1 mask with those for values and the other image that image saying where is specifically pixel by pixel the the Lanes where are we translated into four different images in order to be able to deal with some . 3
17:05:000191:000191_4 : 17:04:25:551: So how far gases the four Lanes and the background we selected the image shape of 256 so everything was reshaped to 256 by 256 . 4
17:05:000192:000192_1 : 17:04:40:717: ESA number photos or TV . 1
17:05:000193:000193_2 : 17:04:44:322: Use 5 different encore scale like the maximum is 128 there will be a quarter of the image 128 by 128 and they married one is specifically because sometimes there are some names that are recorded so it's good to have also little . 2
17:05:000194:000194_3 : 17:05:05:458: Length detected and we train with only one GPU . 3
17:05:000195:000195_4 : 17:05:12:895: Song called that some details I know if you can see there is a good thing I was using numpy is that you can use think like any . 4
17:06:000196:000196_1 : 17:05:24:050: And it's really quick to calculate that with GPU you sing here you can see the n e r d all the things that are circulated in only one operation instead of going position by position in the panda in numpy array you can do it all by in only one operation . 1
17:06:000197:000197_2 : 17:05:46:146: Ok . 2

17:06:000199:000199_4 : 17:06:02:559: Like to say thank NVDIA because of the grants they gave me to give me a brand new GPU to work with and that was really amazing we got like 30 times to the time of training because of the Titan They gave me so we were really grateful about that . 4
17:06:000200:000200_1 : 17:06:25:701: We need 49 a box within 199 hours of 20 time getting to evaluation lots of points 57 . 1
17:07:000201:000201_2 : 17:06:34:832: I will be the loss in training that's not really bad important the training loss cause important is with images that are not part of the training set includes the traffic so that you can see the difference between a training loss and evaluation Los . 2
17:07:000202:000202_3 : 17:06:52:296: The best model is the duration number 41 . 3
17:07:000203:000203_4 : 17:06:57:275: I decided to change their learning rate and things were really bad they went up so we decided to keep the small nothing is perfect in deep your name is really hard and it takes a lot of effort but the thing that you need to understand is that loss is the sum of all the other five losses . 4
17:07:000204:000204_1 : 17:07:19:417: Times they just gets really good for one of the losses but really bad for the out for others so it's a trade-off that the mother makes every time like moving forward iteration by iteration . 1
17:07:000205:000205_2 : 17:07:34:588: It's really important here till the . 2
17:07:000206:000206_3 : 17:07:39:186: The loss of the bounding box . 3
17:08:000207:000207_4 : 17:07:44:327: The mask it's important but not as much as the bounding box . 4
17:08:000208:000208_1 : 17:07:52:473: Some results . 1
17:08:000209:000209_2 : 17:07:55:638: In daylight can detect the two lines or the free lines really good . 2

17:09:000214:000214_3 : 17:08:29:536: This is not a straight line it's a curve and it works and you also have obstruction that cymatics a date at night that's a very difficult task . 3
17:09:000215:000215_4 : 17:08:45:420: It doesn't work the same as night and day but in this image you can see it works really good . 4
17:09:000216:000216_1 : 17:08:52:921: Also without circles the good thing about this is that it understands that there is a LN B be like . 1

17:13:000243:000243_0 : 17:12:13:190: That but not least I would like to end with a fresh so fun and it has that technology pro automation and artificial divisions is definitely one Is that we need to improve you need to call more we need to get into different types of projects we need to learn more and we need to get into more technological stuff that's my advice my two cents all thank you that's my information you can have my email if you need a thing all the guys here it's free for you to take that might have
17:13:000244:000244_1 : 17:12:40:446: I wanted to be and thank you for being here . 1

17:15:000253:000253_3 : 17:14:38:726: Manually collected the pictures it's amazing what he did and I'm grateful because we could move away with that . 3
17:16:000254:000254_4 : 17:14:48:529: Yes the question was safe deposit was made for research or for specifically clients in our case I am working in a specific part of Ultron call icon t-shirt . 4

17:36:000268:000268_2 : 17:35:29:606: Justement pour que tous les élèves apprennent finalement des futurs intéressantes et que l'on puisse prendre des décisions basé sur sur pas mal de de de neurones it . 2
17:36:000269:000269_3 : 17:35:42:154: Et enfin une fois qu'on a donc on a décidé de tout notre modèle de la suite logique d'étape à qu'est-ce qu'on fait qu'est-ce qu'on fait à la fin c'est de choisir ok comment je vais entraîner à mon à mon modèle et notamment j'ai besoin de psy s'appelle un Optimizer et de son appeler une fonction de l'os de la fonction de l'os c'est quelque chose qui va comparer la goutte . 3
17:37:000270:000270_4 : 17:36:05:303: Avec ce qui est qui sort ce qui est le vrai La Belle et donc du coup qui va vous dire ok vous êtes à ce point proche très joyeux une très éloigné de la ou théorique donc il faut agir et agir justement pour choisir des futurs un peu différente agir se faire passer donc appliqué l'optimiseur à votre réseau pour que justement l'extraction de feature se passe légèrement du . 4
17:37:000271:000271_1 : 17:36:34:470: Donc pour notre dataset donc elle NIST donc toujours le data set de . 1
17:37:000272:000272_2 : 17:36:42:623: Chiffre écris écris donc on va l'eau des et justement une fois qu'on a défini tout ça pour notre modèle on peut l'entraîner c'est-à-dire ok on a un échantillon entraînement avec un certain d'images correspondant au Sénat chiffres et les labels correspondant ben je la prends dans mon modèle que pour ses l'image entrez donner à l'écoute théorique c'est bien aller les Alpes août . 2
17:37:000273:000273_3 : 17:37:04:850: Et comme ça j'apprends en fait l'idée c'est que le modèle comprennes que défi ture extraite aussi au fil des couches soit les correspondent il associe à la ouvrez chiffres en août . 3
17:37:000274:000274_4 : 17:37:23:761: Ikea à terme la machine soit capable de manière indépendante à identifier . 4
17:38:000275:000275_1 : 17:37:31:902: Images de la belle correspondant à l'image . 1
17:38:000276:000276_2 : 17:37:37:014: Non partant je vous présente et donc légal donc les d'une heure est-il à Versailles network et donc légal ont été inventé pour générer de l'année . 2
17:38:000277:000277_3 : 17:37:47:978: Donc imaginons que maintenant en fait je veux plus associé a une image de chiffres un chiffre donner mais je veux générer des images de chiffres donc il m'a dit non donc le problème que j'ai c'est que je peux pas dire à quel point je suis loin ou non de la réalité quand je génère une nouvelle image de chiffres donc j'ai pas de moyens de de de los . 3
17:38:000278:000278_4 : 17:38:12:158: Pour calculer sa et donc je vais me baser sur sur sur un principe c'est que quelqu'un va juger mon travail donc imaginons on a un faussaire qui cherche à générer des des œuvre un peu fake pour les revendre parce qu' est-ce que c'est ça fait de l'argent . 4
17:39:000279:000279_1 : 17:38:32:334: À la fin on a un en général un expert qui va dire ça c'est un vrai sauce info donc au passage si vous croyez que c'est un vrai nom c'est un faux c a été généré justement avec avec des gars dans le style roman . 1
17:39:000280:000280_2 : 17:38:48:393: Donc du coup nous qu'est-ce qui va générer justement c'est se donner . 2
17:39:000281:000281_0 : 17:38:54:553: Cécile a jugé c'est donc ce qu'on appelle le générateur et discriminateur générateur discriminateur ça va être tous les deux des réseaux neurones donc en fait on va avoir de réseau de neurones qui vont se battre l'un contre l'autre l'un à générer des données qui soit le plus proche possible de quelque chose de
17:39:000282:000282_4 : 17:39:13:753: Ok ça c'est une donnée en entrée qui qui est invalide qui est réelle de c'est une donnée qui est fake qui a été généré par générateur . 4
17:40:000283:000283_1 : 17:39:24:521: Pour avoir une sorte de variétés de de données générées en entrée ce qu'on va prendre général c'est des valeurs aléatoires un vecteur de taille sans par exemple de variables aléatoires comme ça on va on va avoir des des des output . 1
17:40:000284:000284_2 : 17:39:25:521: Qui vont être un peu différent à chaque fois . 2
17:40:000285:000285_3 : 17:39:44:859: Donc si si on trace un peu le schéma qui correspond à ça donc c'est de réseau le dessinateur et générateur générateur en entrée il prend un vecteur de taille des donc par exemple sens où c'est des valeurs à toi qui va essayer de générer donc des images qui sont pour lui proche du vraisemblable et et justement le rôle du discriminateur ça va être de dire ok de savoir si . 3
17:40:000286:000286_4 : 17:40:14:033: Images qu'on lui donne elle est vraie ou fausse et du coup de prédire cela belle la . 4
17:41:000287:000287_1 : 17:40:21:165: En fait d'avoir ce jeu entre le générateur à froid génial allée des meilleures images et discriminateur après indiscriminée des images sont de plus en plus récent d'emploi . 1
17:41:000288:000288_2 : 17:40:33:292: Si on revient sur sur le modèle Queyras comment ça se passe donc à tout à l'heure on a on a un sens c'est un model keras donc j'ai un peu câlin cachés en définissant une fausse fonction Agathe générateur modèle mais le principe c'est le même c'est-à-dire que on va on va instancier un modèle on va lui passer un certain nombre de couche suivant l'architecture qu'on peut choisir . 2
17:41:000289:000289_3 : 17:40:58:445: Pour le discriminateur et ensuite donc si on se souvient le problème c'est que à la fin du générateur donc quand on a généré des nouvelles images des des images fosse on a pas de mesure de est-ce que mes images sont vraiment correct on va donc du coup en fait notre seul juge ça va être de faire passer ses faux images tu me dégénéré à l'intérieur du discriminateur et de . 3
17:41:000290:000290_4 : 17:41:24:613: On veut du coup c'est tromper discriminateur on sera content le jour où le discriminateur quand il voit une image fausse crédit en fait un vrai . 4
17:42:000291:000291_1 : 17:41:33:537: On va entraîner donc on va avoir un plus gros modèle qui contient justement toute la chaîne de je prends en input du bruit . 1
17:42:000292:000292_2 : 17:41:43:684: Générateur une image fausse puis-je le passant discriminateur et je tiens le label finale de est-ce que c'est une image réelle ou non nous ce que j'appelle discriminatoire Angelina . 2
17:42:000293:000293_3 : 17:41:54:849: Donc la première la première étape c d'enseigner discriminateur à différencier le vrai du faux donc ce qu'on va faire c'est on va d'abord générer des images fausses donc on instancing un bruit . 3
17:43:000294:000294_4 : 17:42:14:026: Associer grâce au générateur et ensuite on va entraîner le discriminateur en disant ok les images que tu vois c'est images qui sont fausses donc c'est tu dois m'envoyer des héros . 4
17:43:000295:000295_2 : 17:42:25:213: Ensuite on va lui passer les vrais images N'oublie vrai image c'est un échantillon du du train et du coup lui a son mot là il doit voir il doit tu veux que tu dois me répondre ok c'est des vrai c'est des vrais images renvoie moi . 2
17:43:000296:000296_3 : 17:42:40:156: Entraîner le discounter à différencier des dunes à Bray-Dunes ma faute mais maintenant ce qu'on veut c'est entraîner le générateur à générer des défauts images qui soit vraisemblable donc du coup ce qu'on fait c'est que donc dans le pré la première étape c'est de dire ok je vais plus entraîner le dessinateur donc maintenant je frise en fait mon dessinateur il est dans l'état où il y . 3
17:44:000297:000297_4 : 17:43:03:337: Entraîner le discounter à différencier des dunes à Bray-Dunes ma faute mais maintenant ce qu'on veut c'est entraîner le générateur à générer des défauts images qui soit vraisemblable donc du coup ce qu'on fait c'est que donc dans le pré la première étape c'est de dire ok je vais plus entraîner le dessinateur donc maintenant je frise en fait mon M'intéresse c'est d'entraîner le générateur donc du coup je prends du bruit et je vais dire que la décision finale donc du discriminateur ça doit être des seins quand je lui fournit du bruit donc je lui fournit du bruit il passe dans le générateur génère dépose images je repasse dans le disque dinateur et ça doit ça doit générer un . 4
17:44:000298:000298_1 : 17:43:26:584: Ça que mon à friser en fait l'état du discriminateur qu'on lui dit ok c'est bien c'est pas bien avec justement la fonction de l'os on va entraîner on va modifier en fait que l'état du générateur et c'est le générateur du coup qui va apprendre à générer des images qui qui colle justement à à la réalité . 1
17:44:000299:000299_2 : 17:43:46:760: Mission voix Auchan mesure de l'entraînement qu'est-ce que ça qu'est-ce que ça donne donc au début c'est rien on voit strictement rien et justement à la fin on voit que les échantillons sont de plus en plus vraisemblable ils sont même indistinguable pour moi sans mauvaise foi donc donc c'est ce principe donc il a été introduit par là il y a une goutte d'eau en 2014 et c'est quel . 2
17:44:000300:000300_3 : 17:44:14:918: Mission voix Auchan mesure de l'entraînement qu'est-ce que ça qu'est-ce que ça donne donc au début c'est rien on voit strictement rien et justement à la fin on voit que les échantillons sont de plus en plus vraisemblable ils sont même indistinguable pour moi sans mauvaise foi donc donc c'est ce principe donc il a été introduit par là il y a une goutte Utiliser à toutes les sauces aujourd'hui et notamment . 3
17:44:000301:000301_4 : 17:44:21:640: Je vais donc dans un kaki et l'image de la rime . 4
17:44:000302:000302_1 : 17:44:22:640: Il y a un papier qui est sorti en 2017 sur justement comment utiliser les dunes un équivalent Versailles networks pour faire de l'image de Ben le ring pour des fous ces images . 1
17:45:000303:000303_2 : 17:44:36:978: Donc maintenant . 2
17:45:000304:000304_3 : 17:44:40:151: Notre tâche c'est plus transformer un chiffre et créer une image de chiffres en valeur chiffres et notre stage c'est de prendre une image dans trekkinn images floutées et en sortit d'avoir une image qui soit complètement net . 3
17:45:000305:000305_4 : 17:44:54:007: Donc comment on fait ça en fait on va prendre exactement le même principe donc avec des jus d'amande et des inputs différents limpo du générateur maintenant ça va être donc une images floutées générateur va essayer justement de générer à partir de cette image flouter une image qui est totalement net et discriminateur lui va essayer d'apprendre à différencier les images . 4
17:45:000306:000306_1 : 17:45:16:157: Qui ont été donc . 1
17:46:000307:000307_2 : 17:45:19:316: Telle qu'elle a des images si on était des foot . 2
17:46:000308:000308_3 : 17:45:25:005: Comment comment on fait ça quelle architecture enfants pour le générateur on prend un qui était pressée je sais pas si vous voyez bien je pense pas c'est ce qu'on appelle . 3
17:46:000309:000309_4 : 17:45:37:166: Une forme de reinette ça a l'avantage en fait de faire passer d'additionner à la fin de bloc Limp où tu es là où tu aimes ça se bloque là il sert juste à apprendre en fait des différences que je dois appliquer sur mon image plutôt que d'apprendre à complètement sortir l'image donc comment on fait ça en Queyras . 4
17:46:000310:000310_1 : 17:45:59:312: TAG Nîmes foot . 1
17:47:000311:000311_2 : 17:46:03:523: Donc au passage du coup je vous un produit à la 2e API de carafe donc ce qui est la paye fonctionnaires donc Ankara soit on ajoute des meilleurs dans un modèle son définir une poutre et on va directement appliqué en fait les couches à cette me coûte donc du coup j'ai un input auquel j'applique donc un pas ligne particulier je le store dans la variable X et ensuite à 7 dans la vie . 2
17:47:000312:000312_3 : 17:46:27:700: Évolution une basse norm est une fonction l'activation particulière et justement en sortie je vais récupérer en fait la somme de Lyme foot et de la haute comme ça en fait l'idée de se couche là c'est vraiment du coup à prendre à quelle différence je dois appliquer à l'image pour obtenir une image nette . 3
17:47:000313:000313_4 : 17:46:49:458: Donc du coup les résultats les lutins sont restés Provent envoie donc sur les parties zoomer donc ça c'est l'image Blu-ray de départ . 4
17:47:000314:000314_1 : 17:47:01:028: Darty qui a été pris qui était qui est sortie début 2017 qui est appartement qui n'utilise pas légal et l'article 2 du coup . 1
17:47:000315:000315_2 : 17:47:12:192: J'ai en fait en paiement tu es en carrosse . 2
17:47:000316:000316_3 : 17:47:16:328: Résultats sont vraiment pro vent et surtout . 3
17:48:000317:000317_0 : 17:47:22:470: Le temps de calcul a été a été diminué. L'article pendant par rapport à o version précédente donc c'est il y a vraiment un intérêt c'est quelque chose qui fonctionne vraiment très bien en ce moment qui améliore les résultats par rapport à utiliser juste un réseau de neurones c d'adversité vraiment d'entraînement pousse des résultats à des valeurs et valeur super . 4
17:48:000318:000318_1 : 17:47:44:628: Quelle dose application il y a . 1
17:48:000319:000319_2 : 17:47:50:766: C'est quelque chose qui s'appelle donc ligne painting c'est-à-dire donc en fait on enlève la partie une partie de l'image et justement pour créer à partir de 7h grâce à des ganons retrait l'intérieur de ce qui se passe se transformer en fait générer une image à partir d'un texte donc à partir d'un texte descriptif créer une image qui correspond à la description du texte . 2
17:48:000320:000320_3 : 17:48:17:954: C'est quelque chose qui s'appelle donc ligne painting c'est-à-dire donc en fait on enlève la partie une partie de l'image et justement pour créer à partir de 7h grâce à des ganons retrait l'intérieur de ce qui se passe se transformer en fait générer une image à partir d'un texte donc à partir d'un texte descriptif créer une C'est aussi donc transformer . 3
17:49:000321:000321_4 : 17:48:22:197: Segmenter en imagerie elle se transformer des vues aériennes enfants en carte c'est aussi transformer des dessins pas mal Google a publié justement tout de suite un site pour où je dessine un chat et ça te ça tu sors le Shack pas forcément chat . 4
17:49:000322:000322_1 : 17:48:43:357: Il y a eu aussi pas mal de transformation par exemple de Yellowstone de été en hiver hiver en été . 1
17:50:000323:000323_2 : 17:48:52:079: Chose qui vraiment assez assez ça a percé on va dire qu' il y a beaucoup de papiers de recherche qui sont en ce moment si vous voulez vous avez intéressé du coup je vous ai mis . 2
17:50:000324:000324_3 : 17:49:06:233: Donc des liens pour carafe donc le lien pour la doc mais aussi un lien d'un cours que j'ai eu l'occasion de suite à ce incroyable D/:/D lien pour des implémentations de justement degenerativa de Versailles network . 3
17:50:000325:000325_4 : 17:49:24:390: Beaucoup beaucoup de variantes et et c'est d'ailleurs dur de dessus tellement tellement il y a même si vous avez des questions il était pas . 4
17:50:000326:000326_2 : 17:49:55:130: Je t'avoue que je connais pas ce que c'est pas la voiture parking donc je veux je peux pas répondre comme ça . 2
17:51:000327:000327_3 : 17:50:11:889: Ah ok c'est genre écrire écrire en gros . 3
17:51:000328:000328_4 : 17:50:30:333: Ouais je vois . 4
17:51:000329:000329_0 : 17:50:36:675: Je pense que je pense que à terme c'est donc la question c'est est-ce que on peut enlever est-ce qu'on peut enlever par exemple des traces dans les images des des des textes des logos des choses comme ça j'ai vu des exemples où justement en fait il y avait ils ont retiré il y avait ils ont une photo avec plein de texte écrit
17:51:000330:000330_2 : 17:51:02:848: Écris et justement ils ont enlevé enlevé grâce adegan justement de poulet la présence de texte sur l'image pour sortir une image fluide en sortie . 2
17:52:000331:000331_3 : 17:51:13:641: Chose qui te fait . 3
17:52:000332:000332_4 : 17:51:16:782: Arrêt du coup le jeu de données sur le Canada c'est il s'appelle GoPro large c'est un jeu qui fait 9 Go veux près . 4
17:52:000333:000333_1 : 17:51:43:930: C'est assez conséquent calme . 1
17:52:000334:000334_2 : 17:51:47:093: Du coup la question c'est comment générer faire un comment faire en sorte que générateur génère des décembre elle suce tellement différent . 2
17:52:000335:000335_3 : 17:52:12:315: Alors justement en fait donc ce qu'il faut savoir c'est que la figure où il y a que des 8 c'est une figure c'est une variante dégaine s'appelle les conditionnel Gan où justement tu passes en fait la classe d'entrée donc que tu souhaites en a où pousse à l'entrée du générateur justement pour que le Laoul générer sois sois là c'est fait exprès c'est fait exprès pour voir en fait . 3
17:53:000336:000336_4 : 17:52:34:449: L'entraînement . 4
17:53:000337:000337_1 : 17:52:38:597: Avec un avec ça moi je dirais que en prenant un taille d'entrée en taille entrée avec toi qui sont suffisamment large lanterne de bruit le risque output sois toujours le même est faible je . 1
17:53:000338:000338_2 : 17:52:57:508: Saurais pas te donner Dodie des . 2
17:53:000339:000339_3 : 17:53:01:653: Une autre question . 3
17:53:000340:000340_4 : 17:53:09:512: Ouais . 4
17:53:000341:000341_1 : 17:53:17:003: Enregistrement le discriminatoire il a entraîné sur du vrai et du faut donc d'abord en fait je l'entraîne sur sur des senteurs réel et descendre bols générer généralement justement pour l'entraîner à différencier . 1
17:54:000342:000342_2 : 17:53:41:174: Une époque donnée à lui faire différentiel qui est réelle de s'il est pas . 2
17:54:000343:000343_4 : 17:53:47:359: Si on vient . 4
17:55:000344:000344_1 : 17:53:52:511: J'en viens ici du coup en première partie toute la première partie c'est vraiment entraîner d'abord le discriminateur sur ok j'arrive à dire que imaginé rester des héros et add Saint-Paul qui viennent de l'échantillon de Trane dire que c'est des en fait on répète ce process entraîne le discriminateur Nantes Rennes le générateur et ainsi de suite et c'est comme ça que je dis fumigateur du . 1
17:55:000345:000345_2 : 17:54:22:684: J'en viens ici du coup en première partie toute la première partie c'est vraiment entraîner d'abord le discriminateur sur ok j'arrive à dire que imaginé rester des héros et add Saint-Paul qui viennent de l'échantillon de Trane dire que c'est des en fait on répète ce process entraîne le discriminateur Nantes Rennes le générateur et ainsi de suite et c'est comme ça La compétence de différentiel et son père réel de décembre pas le choix . 2
17:55:000346:000346_0 : 17:54:28:408: C'est ça en fait donc l'idée c'est que donc tu output du discriminateur qui est donc son à zéro soit un donc en fonction de ça tu calculer un écart à ce que tu voudrais avoir toi et je te mens tu fais donc la descente de gradient surtout tu te couches je sais pas si tu as fait beaucoup de résumé en avance donc du coup en fait une
17:55:000347:000347_4 : 17:55:02:540: 2D dessinateur pour pas que les Aussois impacter et donc du coup en fait on gradient la valeur ton granions tu l'as propage toujours dans les couches en fait du générateur et c'est comme ça qu'il devient meilleur à après dire descendre Pellerey . 4
17:56:000348:000348_1 : 17:55:17:666: Page générée la dernière . 1
17:56:000349:000349_2 : 17:55:22:269: Pour faire la date augmentation . 2
17:56:000350:000350_3 : 17:55:40:281: Je sais pas donc la question c'est est-ce que l'on peut utiliser utiliser légal pour faire de la date augmentation pour du coup entraîner d'hôtes réseau par exemple sur . 3
17:57:000351:000351_4 : 17:55:59:451: Je sais pas si aujourd'hui c'est c'est c'est si ça a été tenté je sais pas si ça améliore les laisse corde autre réseau sur les tâches . 4
17:57:000352:000352_2 : 17:56:09:628: Je suis d'accord je suis d'accord je me suis pas renseigné sur est-ce que est-ce que je te manque des gens qui ai fait l' expérimentation là-dessus faut savoir quand même que pour arriver justement régénérer décembre pas qu'ils soient suffisamment convaincant il faut quand même un certain d'images en départ du coup si tu as peu d'images pour entraîner son au trésor priori tu as pas dit . 2
17:58:000353:000353_3 : 17:56:38:015: Je suis d'accord je suis d'accord je me suis pas renseigné sur est-ce que est-ce que je te manque des gens qui ai fait l' expérimentation là-dessus faut savoir quand même que pour arriver justement régénérer décembre pas qu'ils soient suffisamment convaincant il faut quand même un certain d'images en départ du coup si tu as peu d'images pour entraîner Prends ma générer les données qui soit un peu sensée et donc du coup tu as le risque soit les données soit complètement enfin soit pas représentative de ce que tu aurais en réel . 3
18:52:000354:000354_0 : 17:57:09:616: Ouais du coup enfin moi pour l'entraînement du coup la question c'est à quelle est la taille de machine à utiliser pour donc soit pour l'entraînement sur pour générer de nouvelles images moi j'ai entraîné sur AWS ça m'a pris assez appris à peu près 15h sur une sur la plus petite enfance avec GPU donc c'est quand même important
18:52:000355:000355_2 : 17:57:45:789: - d'important mais mais c'est quand même quelque chose qui est pas fait que tout le monde peut pas faire tout le monde n'a pas accès et même pour en fait pour prédire une image il faut quand même avoir une GPU disponible parce que même si le temps de prédiction est pas énorme tu as besoin quand même de pouvoir afin d'avoir suffisamment de RAM pour l'instant s'il . 2
18:52:000356:000356_3 : 17:58:04:947: Et as quelque chose qui prend beaucoup de place . 3
