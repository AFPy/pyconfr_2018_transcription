10:07:000013:000013_2 : 10:02:28:116: Look at this . 2
10:07:000014:000014_3 : 10:03:03:269: Just for fun . 3
10:07:000015:000015_4 : 10:03:08:444: Andrea Anders army for front of the camera . 4
10:07:000016:000016_2 : 10:07:14:165: Open . 2
10:08:000017:000017_3 : 10:07:25:382: That's ok we can come in Birmingham . 3
10:08:000018:000018_4 : 10:07:32:562: You can drag drop rate . 4
10:09:000019:000019_1 : 10:07:47:710: I said I should get me up at 5 . 1
10:09:000020:000020_2 : 10:07:59:893: Isaac's list of one thing . 2
10:10:000021:000021_3 : 10:08:06:070: It's quite . 3
10:10:000022:000022_4 : 10:08:25:790: I don't . 4
10:10:000023:000023_1 : 10:09:54:949: Say hello everyone I know it's coming here so I'll be talking about forecasting and observing our friends using fighting a neural networks so just a quick question lake house lake how many of you heard that the earlier you book a flight ticket but cheaper . 1
10:11:000024:000024_2 : 10:10:16:144: Most assume I love it so I'm here to bus that time of your bubble saying that that's not it's a very common misconception that the earlier you book a flight the cheaper so that I actually have a minimum let's say I'm going to book a flight 90 days from now so is it the right time to book or do you think you should wait you never show right so just let us just look so yeah it is a . 2
10:11:000025:000025_0 : 10:10:42:317: The cheaper but this is one typical example of a third of a price if you can see from 16 to 90 days before departure the price
10:12:000026:000026_4 : 10:10:57:480: The trend of one part of a line it's very difficult to generalize the fat friend saying that ok I'm going to see about the one where I can find this this is one particular case but I'm just giving you an example where it is not it doesn't follow the common rule that the older you will be cheaper and also before that the analysis and the data I've collected was unfortunately . 4
10:12:000027:000027_1 : 10:11:21:621: Airline so I think you'll see a few names which are Indian airlines so yeah you can stalk you just ignore that so why is why does a fare change and how does it matter so basically every airline that she has 100 seats they try to optimise their revenue from that particular flight so what day do they have different fare classes or rbbb just called reservation booking there's . 1
10:13:000028:000028_2 : 10:11:48:771: So we have let's say 10 tickets for a 20 tickets for B30 tickets for sea and so on so every fare class has a different version and it is very days in the Demand so for example on weekends the fare classes I change very frequently because the demand is high during weekdays it slow so what happens is let's say the 5 tickets in the first or the lowest fare class are solo . 2
10:13:000029:000029_3 : 10:12:15:031: So quickly changes to the next freight so for example to be there different fare classes and you can see or two of us a class is the fare is never see if you don't increasing or decreasing it's something start of the Day start off with the lowest fare class but that's not guarantee so I feel divisions which I haven't added and the presentation for example a few Airlines . 3
10:13:000030:000030_4 : 10:12:40:167: Have a constant starting rate for example like if the flight is introduced 120 days in advance they have the minimum fare and that is a general roots but for some Airlines they have different first for example if a flight is going from Madrid to Barcelona, one airline what they try to do is be a very diverse and beginning itself for example I have $100 $200 and $300 and all . 4
10:14:000031:000031_1 : 10:13:05:376: Change the prices change with the demands and a few Airlines they have $100 constant and the fare keeps increasing article so it depends on the airline sometimes but this is a gender do like for every airline has an army DVD . 1
10:14:000032:000032_2 : 10:13:24:505: You may wonder ok is it always the case or how often does it happen that you know I booked the fair and it goes down so the answer is . 2
10:14:000033:000033_0 : 10:13:35:427: So if you can see me this are six indian airlines and the probability that there is a minimum fare coming up so if you can see you run a line Air India is has only 25/:/ of ability that the fair might go down so if I'm looking at night or flight 90s from now only in 10 or 15 days I can find a fair which is less than the fair know the currency of UAE Airlines like this. It is about . 3
10:15:000034:000034_4 : 10:13:36:427: That means you should probably wait longer before you book a flight at night so again it varies according to the . 4
10:15:000035:000035_1 : 10:14:12:804: The most important part of my analysis was not the modelling part because building a model is a second part and the airline data there is not much public information available for example like if you're looking at booking site Lexus Skyscanner what do you think you see the price you think of each day of the departure and the days to departure the only three features of a . 1
10:15:000036:000036_2 : 10:14:37:939: Lights so we can I use more data or data apart from that to make any predictions so you should try and model Are Data in such a way that we are able to overcome that so I made a few visualisations which help me out more features to the data for example so how is waiting so it always happens with me that ok I have a journey coming up in 80 to 90 days and I have next sale . 2
10:15:000037:000037_3 : 10:15:06:069: So now I always wonder OK how many days do you think I can wait televise increase . 3
10:16:000038:000038_0 : 10:15:14:199: Mail.ru can wait at least 4 to 5 days before the 5 time goes on which means you have 4 to 5 days to think before you book the flights so let's see how that body's so this again a few Airlines so let's say for indigo for 1 to 20 days before departure the average waiting time is 1.822 days so which means there is a flight coming up in 20 days you can wait for an average . 4
10:16:000039:000039_1 : 10:15:44:343: Before the price changes . 1
10:16:000040:000040_0 : 10:15:47:483: Who is the highest were 21 to 40 days in most of the cases then again it varies according to deadline because lots of thing thanks again definitely a line because it depends on the traffic at that particular airport the number of flights the Airlines operating because one flight can have a lot of flights operating between two destinations
10:17:000041:000041_3 : 10:16:14:618: The highest number of flights operating between two popular destinations where is the starter or Air India have a less number of lights compared to Indigo . 3
10:18:000042:000042_4 : 10:16:24:743: Toyota Aygo features we can add into the model but that is only when have a lot of cities for example you're looking at 150 cities then you can either feature saying that ok what does the traffic of this particular a line at the airport or what is the traffic light as a percentage of flights operating between these two destinations that is when it is going to matter what if you only do . 4
10:18:000043:000043_2 : 10:16:50:917: Afford three or four cities it wouldn't dream at that website so the next one is with David Essex Oh this is a video of journey so it's kind of obvious that the price goes up in during the weekends during the weekdays do you say about the optimal dose for you to travel so that if I'm flying I'm flying back on Sunday after the conference as Show me how to India so yeah this is the end there is an observation which means this is the video of johny there is another company video of the day when you're booking the flights or should you book a flight on Saturday compared to Friday or Tuesday so what do you think which would be the cheapest booking it on a Friday or Saturday or Tuesday so I think it was about when . 2
10:18:000044:000044_3 : 10:17:42:282: It was the best day you can book your flight where is Friday and Saturday were the most expensive days to book a flight not to travel to book of Life survey also plays a crucial role in my model so the week day of Departure and the weekday of booking the two features which after looking at these numbers . 3
10:19:000045:000045_0 : 10:18:08:228: Subida a few observations and apart from that there was one other observation I wish I couldn't idea which is the time slot of journey let's say it's morning evening night midnight late night or afternoon so this also much as a lot because late or early morning and evening flights time to be costlier that is obvious again come by
10:19:000046:000046_1 : 10:18:34:413: Observation what is generated across the airlines so there are a few observations which vary over a line the type of a language using and a few which do not vary over the choice of airlines and we can directly for . 1
10:19:000047:000047_2 : 10:18:52:343: I took something about the data preparation and the data cleaning so as you can see the data we had was just the price of the flight than the number of days to departure in big babies weather right how do I even spray Barrett to fit in too much . 2
10:20:000048:000048_0 : 10:19:13:483: you use a regression which means you try to predict the price of a particular team right let's see if I'm looking at Skyscanner now and I have a flight from Malaga to Barcelona which is $100 so I can build a model which predicts the price of the flight 60 days I'm going on 90 years down the line or I predict true or false a yes or no. . 3
10:20:000049:000049_4 : 10:19:37:626: It's amazing it's a classification of a great see you again and be objective is what shapes your data preparation so if you just want a yes or no for today like if I'm looking at Skyscanner should I not yes or no . 4
10:21:000050:000050_0 : 10:19:54:757: Find very useful because what may happen is that it says no because there is a $1 decrease in price predictor so the second case be more useful where you can see the prices everyday lights so let's say you see that ok I'm only going to make $10 which is not a big deal for me let me move the slide let's I'm going to save $50 on a flight
10:21:000051:000051_2 : 10:20:21:973: Muesli more helpful but it is also very difficult because so the data collected was only for 13 cities because I collected the data myself on a local computer . 2
10:21:000052:000052_0 : 10:20:36:084: Which I collected a really that's a scraper which run itself every day so it took about 45 hours for the scraper to run and it used to collect data on these 13 cities for 90 days in advance so I look at the basis 90 days from.now for 13 cities of domination 13 c to about a million rows everyday . 3
10:22:000053:000053_4 : 10:21:05:205: Because when I started my presentation I thought it would be a few thousand rows are a million dollars at Max but it turned out to be about 115 million rows . 4
10:22:000054:000054_1 : 10:21:18:355: Sigma analysis was 7 Days which is also difficult to do alexandrine in the grass is everything so yeah I mean building that's great but very difficult and I talked about it once like a few challenges I faced celebrities I've used I don't even use beautifulsoup and everything I just had to use a request library in the web page API json and json a monkey . 1
10:23:000055:000055_2 : 10:21:49:503: thousands urls each containing about hundreds urls which I had to scrape so how to process them very properly write because so let's see if a script is only for photo files they might be a possibility that your laptop goes off so it was my laptop so that is however is it . 2
10:23:000056:000056_3 : 10:22:08:660: No change there might be internet outage they might be an exception the server might reject your request so all these are handled by the court which means the good lunch independently without any human intervention that's because I am I won't have time to sit with us for 45 hours I was in such a way that it doesn't mean human intervention any . 3
10:23:000057:000057_0 : 10:22:31:813: Window scraping back 15 to 2000 urls every day but still I used simple stacks and queues to push and only 15 requests every minute so that the website doesn't reject my request and handling is minimal but I still have measures to take care of 403 others which is this website refusing a response and let's see if let's say the website in
10:24:000058:000058_1 : 10:23:03:987: Electro 60 seconds to 120 seconds depending on the speed with which it was creeping there now and then is waiting then gets back to work again so I . 1
10:24:000059:000059_2 : 10:23:16:109: I also use multi-processing library in Python which piece of the process by 5 times depending on the number of course so if I would have used I run the script on a server I could have used more threats because it has more number of course my laptop only had like five to eight so I could only use 5 to 8 parallel processes then cron jobs soap for those who do . 2
10:24:000060:000060_3 : 10:23:47:244: I also use mylee processing library my ear piercing in Python which piece of the process by 5 times depending on the number of course so if I would have used I run the script on a server I could have used more threats because it has more number of course my laptop only had like five to eight so I could only use 5 to 8 parallel processes then It is a very simple schedule English any computer gives you where you can schedule a task for every 10 seconds or Evian minutes every 10 days a week and months so I use use these things for doing things like downloading my TV series every week or executing a cold every day or something like that in university and it turned out to be very very helpful so a Cron job make sure . 3
10:25:000061:000061_0 : 10:24:15:510: You're scraping runs every day without you actually having to sit down and run everyday at 1 a.m. the scraper restarts itself dance till the morning and then she was it so you can obviously add a day loans and stuff so that you can just go through it once you get up so this is how you can automate and you can do things like this is very
10:25:000062:000062_1 : 10:24:42:691: Schedule lady don't have to worry about it raining or executing stuff like that very carefully before you . 1
10:25:000063:000063_2 : 10:24:51:840: Then I go up to 4 days of Execution thanks and I did not use things like multiple proxies or fake IP addresses so I might have an idea this is so what happens there is that are you imitate like tries to imitate . 2
10:26:000064:000064_3 : 10:25:10:963: Multiple servers like ages 10 to 15 IP addresses to keep rotating different IP addresses so the website doesn't block you so that is how I usually like the same people who scream billions of pieces of everyday use reuse fake Yeezys fake IP addresses or different proxies to make sure their website doesn't bloat . 3
10:26:000065:000065_4 : 10:25:37:115: Who is that because you have to pay for that so yes . 4
10:26:000066:000066_0 : 10:25:42:239: Are you might be running with the resource for a model train show the modern thing here is a classification one not a regression one because I did not have the computing forward to actually build a model store the data and run the Moors murders so this is just a classification model which means that It just gives you a yes or no. depending on the day so it has features like . 1
10:27:000067:000067_2 : 10:25:43:239: Obviously the price today then the week day of the departure of the week day today and things like that and this is this is probably the simplest model you can build this site this is a simple ANN so it's about 5 to 6 lines of course vary who is using tensorflow there is a . 2
10:27:000068:000068_0 : 10:26:30:591: Leona divide symbol for 30 to 16. . 3
10:27:000069:000069_0 : 10:26:36:720: An alarm for your networks and deep learning but this is the basic my life babe I've been working more than the data preparation and data cleaning because I thought that was more important when you're building a model of this site and the accuracy was 73/:/ which is not bad I mean I've seen I've read research papers best
10:27:000070:000070_1 : 10:26:58:891: Any accuracy cancer comes out to be almost the same place we have 75 to 73 position in league . 1
10:28:000071:000071_0 : 10:27:08:016: True positives by two numbers is
10:28:000072:000072_3 : 10:27:16:153: Make sure you have to understand that are 1000 cases there are only a few hundred cases where you can actually save money so it is very difficult for a model to identify those days so I am trying to build the Sea by tomatoes like I know that ordinance work very good are better with time series data compared to a simple neural networks but that again . 3
10:30:000073:000073_4 : 10:27:47:279: This project will be building a model on data and against using more data let's say and features like the traffic at the airport which depends again on the number of cities using so yeah I think that is it from my sight . 4
10:31:000075:000075_1 : 10:28:05:412: No I mean happy to answer any questions if you have . 1
10:31:000076:000076_2 : 10:28:10:655: Ok great thank you . 2
