10:32:000077:000077_3 : 10:31:40:287: Fence is really important so I would like to tell you it is really important thing you need to insist . 3
10:32:000078:000078_4 : 10:31:41:287: You can really change everything with that and it's it is a python . 4
10:33:000079:000079_1 : 10:31:54:687: I would like to say why we chose python and Y Python still fighting and always python and white fighting really suits our needs in terms of recruiting and terms of development in terms of production and then I would like to give an application with some details something a bit more research . 1
10:33:000080:000080_2 : 10:32:16:835: As well because you've got free for machine learning techniques and 3 ft python party packages which are used and it gives really nice of Kent exam so I've got 25 minutes if you want him to interrupt with questions questions that is welcome otherwise we can ask question again after that . 2
10:33:000081:000081_3 : 10:32:40:758: This is the home page of City Council schools in this moment so we are celebrating 20 years of existence and it is a special offer you can find on the homepage see if things do I think it's new realise we've got 20 years of experience and it's really a big big site so why you should listen to this took so it's ok about data Science the first thing about that sounds of state . 3
10:34:000082:000082_4 : 10:33:10:907: So do you have to state and it can we really be all know that on this day that fits yes because you've got millions of customers we've got millions of visitors so customers and not customers every day which generates dance of cloaks and we would like to predict the behaviour of this visitors . 4
10:34:000083:000083_1 : 10:33:32:047: Connect me with like to anticipate what the customer would doing the next but we would like to know the cost in is it as well as well so I understand if a particular customer is in a given category or not and we've got a really big catalogue who says Catholics images descriptions so we're talking about NLP problems image recognition problems . 1
10:35:000084:000084_0 : 10:33:56:199: It's problems because 30ml products as pricing problems because the price always changed so for all these data we've got tons of people who got more than 30 that scientists we've got more than 30 ITs and engineers are working exclusively on data so and we've got a variety as well but item instead I'm under that Are Scientists there is no
10:35:000085:000085_3 : 10:34:27:346: Difficult to identify . 3
10:35:000086:000086_4 : 10:34:30:486: This people got different backgrounds that fancies master courses of course but they are mathematicians computer scientists and statiscians for me I am a mathematicians coming from a completely different Sector Council Finance and I've got a PhD in mathematics so I've got colic stream or computer science or rent it and I'll call it was come from insurance statistics akademiks . 4
10:35:000087:000087_0 : 10:34:58:625: Really big variety and the only I just said we've got SQL administrator you've got a group administrator we've got different kind of databases different kind of philosophy so it's is this variety which really stands up data Sciences switch release features of a science because you need to tackle the problems from
10:36:000088:000088_2 : 10:35:28:774: Is the idea that everybody's got an opinion and different angle to tackle the issue . 2
10:36:000089:000089_3 : 10:35:35:052: So we were saying that that data science is everywhere so you might not see it but it is actually really everywhere from the moment you start so imagine you're looking for a product . 3
10:36:000090:000090_4 : 10:35:48:239: then you search for fridge refrigerator on the TV or a computer or whatever so when you when you type something on the Google search bar we find main results . 4
10:36:000091:000091_1 : 10:36:02:064: This results are not I'm a genius in th''//'/e sense that they come from different corners school so on the first line you would see images images are not for free you can see when I say a prayer that you can see different brands which lights are the first spot in the first line of Google and to post images so this is cool Google shopping and it's part of a more broad strategy was go . 1
10:37:000092:000092_2 : 10:36:34:207: Which . 2
10:37:000093:000093_3 : 10:36:35:207: So you pay to be in the first position . 3
10:37:000094:000094_4 : 10:36:42:484: But you need to guarantee not only that you pay you need to go and see a certain quality of your advertised and then you've got the natural research the Dead 2 free research which is Which report issue articles SEO . 4
10:38:000095:000095_1 : 10:37:00:630: Google then decides who's the best and puts your results in the first second and a third on the first line wherein the second page it depends on the quality of your of your SEO score . 1
10:38:000096:000096_2 : 10:37:16:766: In both these cases we've got fully automated Python optimisation an example of the sga for which I work you've got a complete automatic campaign construction so a campain is basically the unit of the . 2
10:38:000097:000097_3 : 10:37:37:901: Group several products about search query so you can make a complaint on computers you can do a campaign of a typical of other type of a phone and Daniel too big for each query you have to be done how much you want to pay for the search query to show on Google this is all fully automatic both creation and animation Building and it's none in Python and the same goes for SEO . 3
10:38:000098:000098_4 : 10:38:10:038: You've got tones of optimisations with that which side and python and it works every day . 4
10:39:000099:000099_1 : 10:38:18:368: Now only imagine you are an cdiscount to see this cool customer and they used to go on a search engine and look for something when you look for something it says it is not trivial to give the user the best user experience and it is not really easy to match what the user wants and what they say the standard search engine would give you so we don't have to say and you were . 1
10:39:000100:000100_2 : 10:38:44:516: For . 2
10:39:000101:000101_3 : 10:38:46:668: Search query something weird so for TV you could find TV series you could find USB key when you can sign find something which has been seen on the TV show The research might not be pertinent so you want to optimise this research and actually have TV when you search for TV and this is the case at the moment and you can see on her on the right side and you can find some soon to live . 3
10:40:000102:000102_4 : 10:39:14:822: We really nice images to do user experience has been optimised to exactly find what you want and it is done once again completly in python . 4
10:40:000103:000103_0 : 10:39:27:990: So the journey continues you choose for something and when you choose for something you don't know you do not want to buy completely blindly so you want to compare sometimes you can pay to add a website that most of the time you can pay within the website so you look forward to hear you've got a really nice one because it is a bit too much for a
10:40:000104:000104_3 : 10:39:54:122: Pair to Samsung similar products so you might want an upgrade or downgrade according to your needs so we give you the opportunity to choose among similar products and once again this is fully automatic and this is done in Python . 3
10:40:000105:000105_4 : 10:40:11:454: But when you come back to you always forget the milk or the bread so you don't we do not want you to forget anything and in case you buy TV you might not have the cable yes or ok to buy a telephone you might need an extra charger and USB so when you buy something we give you the opportunity to choose among complimentary products so the goal is to have a winner winner experience. 4 1
10:41:000107:000107_2 : 10:40:42:816: Complete your basket so you get in this case you can see it till efficient just complete my cables and things to all the TV on the wall . 2
10:41:000108:000108_0 : 10:40:56:919: Say that did I just four examples of things that are there be none in Python but that the science is really everywhere is just so he goes from the we talked before we talk about the catalogue so there is a big data census data scientist in which works in the catalogue guarantees that there are no duplication of products
10:42:000109:000109_4 : 10:41:25:060: Feel the description when you've got nothing to in a description the Catholics comes from many many vendors so you cannot always . 4
10:42:000110:000110_1 : 10:41:35:160: Guarantee the defenders faithful the blanks . 1
10:42:000111:000111_2 : 10:41:39:274: You've got something in finance if that data Science in supply chain so credit scoring is when you when you apply for a credit and yes we have to tell you if you are eligible for the credit or not so it's this is a typical insurance like problem . 2
10:42:000112:000112_3 : 10:41:58:498: And as you can see it is really Justified the big the big team that we are . 3
10:42:000113:000113_4 : 10:42:06:639: Show WiFi so it might sound trivial to you logic Python conference but it's actually no I can't from finance and in finance at least for the moment that when I was working title was not really used except for Prototype as an exception in some headphones black . 4
10:42:000114:000114_1 : 10:42:33:786: Most of the time python is just for prototyping because once you have to go to do to the rear market if you want to think she want . 1
10:43:000115:000115_2 : 10:42:44:935: The fastest speed or C Sharp Orange . 2
10:43:000116:000116_3 : 10:42:51:076: Place a prototype into something . 3
10:44:000117:000117_4 : 10:42:55:222: Something different so many people choose to have a two-stage prototyping first and then production with the translation in the Middle with the middle man that takes your code and transform into something else some people like it some people do not . 4
10:44:000118:000118_1 : 10:43:17:657: And I work in our case Python allows many things but mostly Python allows to reduce the need of the middle man so you it's really fast things changed really quickly and you need to produce I'll do it in production really quickly so if you want a shorter shorten your time-to-market pythons is really good choice because the data scientist becomes the centre and is just one . 1
10:44:000119:000119_2 : 10:43:49:789: From the beginning to the end so there is no train station and there is a sense of responsibility to what's your code so there is no excuse you've got the framework which has been talking for someone else but you're arguing The Miz read the centre and it goes from touch pro2 it take a prototype you play knockout you test the code but then you have got something which is . 2
10:44:000120:000120_3 : 10:44:15:978: Really really fast . 3
10:45:000121:000121_4 : 10:44:19:104: Python is transparent and robust . 4
10:45:000122:000122_1 : 10:44:24:222: It simpler to learn with respect to other languages is my super to learn cplusplus and this is it nevertheless it is really really powerful really general purpose so why why is it important something which is simple listening easy to learn it's nice to have but as we said before we got multiple backgrounds so we cannot ensure that everybody has the same strong background . 1
10:46:000123:000123_2 : 10:44:55:362: Since you need many skills to be a data scientist you cannot be a top secret Space Program the top mathematicians abscess incision and know deep learning and know everything so Python suits the needs it allowed to recruit widely among the community because you can learn it fast and there is a good chance that you learnt before you become a data scientist . 2
10:46:000124:000124_0 : 10:45:20:752: So I find it particularly elegant and it really suits our needs is a strong community if you got the problem don't stack overflow at your finances really quickly you've got tons of libraries which are ready to use which is not the
10:46:000125:000125_4 : 10:45:41:898: You've got Jupiter notebook which is a really game changed if you want to show something really quick we've got the Jupiter notebook you do a graph you sent really really nice and you've got a library as I said before machine learning libraries and you always have the state-of-the-art if there is a is there is an argue that comes out in really short time you will find . 4
10:46:000126:000126_1 : 10:46:08:039: 1 version on python and it's really nice to use immediately so that's why I like python . 1
10:46:000127:000127_2 : 10:46:17:170: As I've got 10 minutes left we will get through and O P guttering are going application so . 2
10:46:000128:000128_3 : 10:46:29:900: This is this is an internist internship subject for nowadays colleague of mine . 3
10:47:000129:000129_4 : 10:46:39:235: On an ISA so they can't import which I'm working . 4
10:47:000130:000130_1 : 10:46:45:379: As we said before . 1
10:47:000131:000131_2 : 10:46:47:970: You might want a new refrigerator and in this case you don't want to pay so much so you looking for an expensive refrigerator or refridgerator an English fish in French . 2
10:47:000132:000132_3 : 10:47:04:094: Manor results you've got before we are just SEO and Google shopping city images and the free results . 3
10:47:000133:000133_4 : 10:47:14:239: I have another one which is called which is issue forms OK Google text Google search . 4
10:48:000134:000134_1 : 10:47:21:721: Who got tax announcement at this time you've got no image but you can give the message he want associated to a given search query and of course you play fat . 1
10:48:000135:000135_2 : 10:47:35:799: We're going to talk about the Google Google search . 2
10:48:000136:000136_3 : 10:47:44:936: What do you play fight this is Google then decides who pays what you can give a maximum amount of money that you would like to pay for a certain search query as a sitting still searching Resurrection with a certain message . 3
10:49:000137:000137_0 : 10:48:04:088: Is coupled I don't work so for example you look for something which is not necessarily word it might be a phrase and you say I want to play 50 cents for each click for this announcement so Google says ok this is you does Amazon's are the people in the auction and it says everybody wants to say something but
10:49:000138:000138_1 : 10:48:34:204: Google takes this to information combined together rank the actors and says ok you're the first the second and third and fourth and you Ithe forth didn't pay enough so we won't show you we've got just free places for this particular query and just the three of you were going this disorder . 1
10:49:000139:000139_2 : 10:48:58:021: This is a Google perspective so far as we have to say how much do you want to pay for this click and it might seem a trivial question it is actually not because you need to know for a given user given query a given moment how much do you expect from this query in terms of Returns so . 2
10:50:000140:000140_3 : 10:49:21:176: Let's take the the history of this query we talk about it we've got a problem most of the key was have no signal at all they exist in a brief moment the first time the people click on the keyboard and then there exist no more so if you look for something really specific it might be there in one year of history you can have just one click 10 plate so how much do you pay . 3
10:50:000141:000141_4 : 10:49:47:384: with square rear we talk about it we've got a problem most of the key was have no signal at all they exist in a brief moment the first time the people click on the keyboard and then there exist no more so if you look for something really specific it might be there in one year of history you can have just one click 10 You know nothing about you can see on the graph on the left side . 4
10:50:000142:000142_1 : 10:49:55:603: You can send a graph on the left side that most of the key words are in this category show more than 80/:/ of The Cure says no signal or nothing about it you would say let's do not be done them any of massive loss so this give us a really important it's like . 1
10:50:000143:000143_2 : 10:50:16:346: Entity they really important you need to be done this but you know nothing about it so what to do you take a keyword sprayer that's fine something which is not fair that looks like in which serve not in be able to put in semantic way so you can change the brand or you can change the colour to assume that someone looks for an iPhone which is pink I don't know if I fancy . 2
10:51:000144:000144_3 : 10:50:44:477: Even be able to put in semantic way so you can change the brand or you can change the colour to assume that someone looks for an iPhone which is pink But it might might have a signal which is . 3
10:51:000145:000145_4 : 10:50:50:699: Good as the iPhone white or the classic iPhone . 4
10:51:000146:000146_1 : 10:50:56:827: Mysterious together and use in your mate just one big to you and you can bid on this on this cluster all together as you can see an example so we put together a telephone black telephone in a white elephant because we did not have signal enough . 1
10:51:000147:000147_2 : 10:51:15:984: Just one bit . 2
10:52:000148:000148_3 : 10:51:19:016: So you always need a slap in Sidmouth and the idea is to protect the Keira's in and embedding space or including space so you've got something text all that you've got fantastic next to convert it to something and marriage but then you have to reduce the dimensions so in order to do the diamond age is the dimensional use the word to wreck algorithms which is . 3
10:52:000149:000149_4 : 10:51:43:146: I really common one and which allows to capture semantics . 4
10:52:000150:000150_1 : 10:51:49:285: Systemantics mens hoodies the voice recording is used able to relate king and queen man and woman and create cufflinks a monkey where switch off got similar opposite meaning it's really able to capture . 1
10:53:000151:000151_2 : 10:52:08:695: The cutest and this allows to project something textual in a space which has got let's 100 100 dimensions is a big space but it is creating space for nuclear space you've got a Distance you've got multiple distance and you can use the distance of the Eucliedean space to . 2
10:53:000152:000152_3 : 10:52:32:839: Insanity work and obtain a distance on them which you can use to plaster . 3
10:53:000153:000153_4 : 10:52:39:702: So coupling the style with Samantha is and servants and scikit-learn interfaces for the simple as not identical but it's just I just need to train the model and then and then used to predict function to create the embedding . 4
10:53:000154:000154_1 : 10:53:01:845: And what did we use are used as an example because it managed to present for packages which I used . 1
10:53:000155:000155_2 : 10:53:13:892: Packages that use in Python which are really useful then allows too short and the same to my cat to the market to use scikit learn for it as idea . 2
10:54:000156:000156_3 : 10:53:26:028: Optimising plastering we use scikit learn as well to produce plastering you can use k mince pasta and you can use erotica plastering both up to this past and you manage to create this group of people who's got the same semantic meaning we use Jensen version of the word to work to . 3
10:54:000157:000157_4 : 10:53:49:055: Embedding and you can use a steamer for example and a TK . 4
10:55:000158:000158_1 : 10:53:57:189: Plumbing is please in French Montana I shall I stay to phone different categories with Creed noise works of art itself is able to understand the semantics but the stemer allows to clean up a bit of problem . 1
10:55:000160:000160_2 : 10:54:14:514: And this is our class to look like this is us a microscope on plastering before we got many many many many years and you can see the plastering actually allowed to separate the model of the telephone so as I said it's a microscope but you can you can see typical telephone with different models so you've got a 45 and you've got different classes for different models which is remark . 2
10:55:000161:000161_3 : 10:54:15:514: You also have the general cluster so when you do not have the motor of the telephone the algorithm Halloween manage to put this . 3
10:55:000162:000162_4 : 10:54:59:889: Vintage . 4
10:55:000163:000163_1 : 10:55:02:039: It's a generic rip . 1
10:55:000164:000164_2 : 10:55:05:890: And so generic group is it is interesting because it is typically a group for people will look for something but rarely buy just . 2
10:55:000165:000165_3 : 10:55:19:544: Pounds to sing the price is a not really profitable cases because that you would take for the text but you will not have a transformational convert . 3
10:55:000166:000166_4 : 10:55:31:718: And finish . 4
10:55:000167:000167_1 : 10:55:35:868: This is a static image . 1
10:56:000168:000168_2 : 10:55:39:014: It's actually dynamic in in in in divisional the original contest you can see the class string on a pulley on a Blackley . 2
10:56:000169:000169_3 : 10:55:50:159: So . 3
10:56:000170:000170_4 : 10:55:53:306: Represents the signal so bigger are bigger keyboard exam so many people and a smaller bubbles are Rescuers and you can find thinking and you can see things to tssc representation . 4
10:57:000171:000171_1 : 10:55:54:306: Space in a two-dimensional space which contracts did I mention that respects the cosine distance so you've got a really nice representation . 1
10:57:000172:000172_0 : 10:56:20:636: Did as possible in really short time thanks to order package Mansion shellac thank you for the attention if you've got any question and ugly. X x . 2
10:57:000173:000173_4 : 10:56:40:981: So the question is is if there is a problem of speed with all the amount of data that we have the answer is of course yes so you need to . 4
10:57:000174:000174_1 : 10:57:01:117: You've got so we train them the mode of the words like more than between on a Catholic and as I said before I've got millions of products so the description not really there are many many many inscriptions to take some time but . 1
10:57:000175:000175_2 : 10:57:16:264: You can have it mate once once you fit the model out in . 2
10:58:000176:000176_3 : 10:57:21:399: Musical Fantasy 14 Trek is Roger Rabbit if you got a problem so speed you can split . 3
