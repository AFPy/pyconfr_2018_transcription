10:01:000025:000025_0 : 10:00:56:609: Anyway so that's a good listener and currently I'm working at height is data what we do is distributed postgresql so if you take care and you have too many transaction hour or two too many days are in 2/8 chicken nugget in many different server and each one of them is going to have only a part of the day that the same scheme everywhere but only a part of the data. It's called the sharding. 1
10:01:000026:000026_2 : 10:01:19:744: And I mean that in a transit traduction away so it's quite nice . 2
10:01:000027:000027_3 : 10:01:26:058: But if you have troubles with a scaling out for the rest will have a look inside you later with a nice things . 3
10:01:000028:000028_4 : 10:01:34:367: Most of the examples I'm going to to peek here today come from the book I wrote last year it's called are mastering postgresql in application Development so it's a book about meant to be read by Lopez . 4
10:02:000029:000029_1 : 10:01:49:513: And . 1
10:02:000030:000030_2 : 10:01:51:644: Petrobras grand hotel like . 2
10:02:000031:000031_3 : 10:01:57:785: Stop lines of code into a simple as queries . 3
10:02:000032:000032_4 : 10:02:01:902: Most of the time the Ripper's they don't know what to do with really with a sequel what is possible to do even so it's all about that and you have a discount if you want to use it . 4
10:02:000033:000033_1 : 10:02:13:046: Cause we love python . 1
10:02:000034:000034_2 : 10:02:17:172: Decipher code you will have to do this comes . 2
10:03:000035:000035_3 : 10:02:22:154: For those of you who are not using postgresql yet check out a bit louder he can do a formulation in one command line as you do digital there . 3
10:03:000036:000036_4 : 10:02:37:287: I've just ordered to be is the connection string of the target of the ways which must be possessed girl and eat a tomato everything as commodity indexes constraints everything is migrating to one come and so it's really easy so . 4
10:03:000037:000037_1 : 10:02:52:427: Cancel that you have no excuses if you're not using postgresql yet you just one command line and then you can use it so no issues ok . 1
10:03:000038:000038_2 : 10:03:02:191: Bolivia started now . 2
10:03:000039:000039_3 : 10:03:05:027: Why would anyone use a relational database management system RGB MSC tomoko it's complexity complex to use . 3
10:03:000040:000040_4 : 10:03:15:170: About it . 4
10:04:000041:000041_1 : 10:03:17:301: The meaning to Reigate from the repairs when we talk to be there it's like it's for . 1
10:04:000042:000042_2 : 10:03:24:461: What is serialisation pizza place to save data everybody knows how to open a file for writing year 4 reading so sleeping late I don't need another device management system for doing that right if you just want to save data open the file . 2
10:04:000043:000043_3 : 10:03:44:606: And that is done during by deciding to be XML because that's what they do in may be doing more json XML so maybe something to be . 3
10:04:000044:000044_4 : 10:03:59:755: The Prime of saving a file data storage so . 4
10:04:000045:000045_1 : 10:04:04:885: A lot of odds to reach . 1
10:05:000046:000046_2 : 10:04:08:017: Concurrency undulation . 2
10:05:000047:000047_3 : 10:04:11:463: Continue accessing the data from several active connections that the time they say you're doing a web front end in vein in Python so there is what do you call the claim code when we look at things from the database the time code is going to be your back-end coding Python write . 3
10:05:000048:000048_4 : 10:04:35:614: Going to have a multiple instances running in parallel off your back and cold let say if you to web service you will have one back and active there are currently connected user so you will have many uses may be doing things concurrently and you want your system to be consistent at all time that's why not you use a relational database management system the system is going to answer that . 4
10:05:000049:000049_1 : 10:05:02:746: You are safe and consistent for everyone to use in parallel in a concrete way so let's dig into that a little . 1
10:05:000050:000050_2 : 10:05:14:329: Currency in the greatest damage begins with the famous a seed a little so everybody's heard about ACS . 2
10:06:000051:000051_0 : 10:05:24:432: There were going to talk about you. You told her in a practical the way home to be a CD need to be at to make . 3
10:06:000052:000052_4 : 10:05:33:370: The really important thing about that seed is that most of us that's all we learnt about the Audi BMS and when we got started at school or maybe elsewhere to develop and so it's something we can trust that it is really so I get back to the side when you pick . 4
10:07:000053:000053_1 : 10:05:54:510: database management system solution there are many many out there today and most of them are not a seed because there are two if you're free drop one of the letters is going to be much easier to implement likes getting out there are things with you teach us actions so we should take us another example do you have a CD or not to . 1
10:07:000054:000054_2 : 10:06:19:653: Have you but you don't you're going to be in trouble I like to pick a number to be because it's so easy so which ones have the letter does not going to be as in acid while he doesn't have transactions so you will see a and you lose the I write it deletes a schematic design so that means you cannot undo consistency used knows nothing about the data definition is Converse . 2
10:07:000055:000055_0 : 10:06:43:802: Used to be an adorable ok 04 a little bit may be ok for your application to deal with her and she said that has nothing to do with a seat but you need to remember that either have it or you don't stand there what it means when you write the code so a to make mince to control back so when you send the commit message to the device
10:07:000056:000056_4 : 10:07:10:924: Send a commit message you are supposed to check that the messages that you get back is actually a commit and not a rollback ok so for example if you select 1 ÷ 0 . 4
10:07:000057:000057_1 : 10:07:25:534: We are evaluating division by zero we can we don't know how to do that and so then you can say come it let me say to roll back . 1
10:08:000058:000058_2 : 10:07:34:661: The transaction when the weather in the world before ok . 2
10:08:000059:000059_3 : 10:07:40:800: Like when you ask for a country to use pytest Amy's full . 3
10:08:000060:000060_4 : 10:07:45:033: Section read and write something and then when you commit a message you get back his back so sorry about that you can continue reading the data but not write into it and it's because when you have that . 4
10:08:000061:000061_0 : 10:08:01:166: This process continues running until you make some room for it so maybe you have decided that mean by that is like one terabyte big and so when you are faced semi sweet you please follow you delete decided which schools did it to me for a reason so you did it and then you can continue working and supple then the next day
10:08:000062:000062_2 : 10:08:24:291: I need works very well with a bus Bristol to remember that transactions when you write Python code may be you and I don't really need that but then think about that what happens if a system is food in the middle of your transaction . 2
10:09:000063:000063_3 : 10:08:39:386: And are you supposed to be writing to things and in between the two fi system is full what's next if you're using cosmic girl you don't care because you just have a roll back instead of a comets and you can continue OK . 3
10:09:000064:000064_4 : 10:08:54:406: Stance mean that . 4
10:09:000065:000065_1 : 10:08:57:816: Are we going to back to consistent in a minute but consistency is that you know what you have in your daddy later that you can trust your data so you know what you having the data set you need to have a schema so you need to be clear your intention that let you do when you write yours if you want to write nice code you need to declare your intention of the ways people . 1
10:09:000066:000066_2 : 10:09:17:932: Off to work we will continue every single line of code you wrote it and it's the same thing so you have a structured data model that you can use . 2
10:10:000067:000067_3 : 10:09:29:943: Got it and see . 3
10:10:000068:000068_4 : 10:09:34:055: Ireland data types we are very large set of the two types there are in the default voicemail setup 72 that it's ok it's not just into json text going to have points you can have so many things . 4
10:10:000069:000069_1 : 10:09:51:065: The first thing is that the data looks like would you choose look like so that's the type constraints like not . 1
10:10:000070:000070_2 : 10:10:01:206: And some people who think that I recorded relief allowed because there is more in his that's not true so the thing about it that way we going to get back on the relations and whether you are in sequel the fact that you have a friend he has nothing to do with the fact that we call it a relational database and it was so we get back that feels . 2
10:10:000071:000071_3 : 10:10:24:344: Call to . 3
10:11:000072:000072_4 : 10:10:26:481: And so in the room who likes to write circumference . 4
10:11:000073:000073_1 : 10:10:31:097: Does many of us ok that's fine my hope is that by the end of the more people we are so that the sound . 1
10:11:000074:000074_2 : 10:10:42:232: And meet me closer you have a review of the system of the rule system that is running at the movie of it in postgresql database in your Python code usually you are implementing user workflow so you're doing things for one user at a time so it's easy to undo that whatever you do is come to stand for one user but I do you make it consistent for the rule system I keep your . 2
10:11:000075:000075_3 : 10:10:43:232: Stop system . 3
10:11:000076:000076_4 : 10:11:12:590: One day I can buy the last item but not two of them because there is only one . 4
10:11:000077:000077_1 : 10:11:19:743: Review of the whole system is going to be like today that allows management system to handle that . 1
10:11:000078:000078_2 : 10:11:27:180: I in ACID is for isolation . 2
10:11:000079:000079_3 : 10:11:31:081: It is it . 3
10:11:000080:000080_4 : 10:11:34:212: Mix atomicity and alliteration it's the other side of the same thing . 4
10:12:000081:000081_1 : 10:11:40:805: Things that bring your own protection you begin you can do whatever you want . 1
10:12:000082:000082_2 : 10:11:47:927: How to make mince nobody sees what you're doing it until you come it . 2
10:12:000083:000083_3 : 10:11:52:569: Minster you have a choice of whether you want to see what the other guy did or that during your own selection did you done for example so it's a logical backup of your database . 3
10:13:000084:000084_0 : 10:12:04:996: Nazi whatever happens so when you be a Beautiful Day begin and then select from tables and it wants to see the same Snapchat of the database during all its processing so it's going to say I don't I don't want to see anything that happens if someone is ringing in certain commits in between I do to select from this table and select
10:13:000085:000085_1 : 10:12:27:121: I want to have a consistent backup and so did you don't be going to a start a transaction in either as serializable mode or read repeated mode but your Python code to is going to have the same man set up so you can choose for your back and application to be in a week committed or the default is submitted is not your fault or reputable read which means that if I do a select and . 1
10:14:000086:000086_2 : 10:12:55:254: I'm going to see exactly the same data as long as I am in the same transaction right by default if you do a select GunStar from the table then someone else doesn't insert and then then you select can start again you see 1 more ok don't plus one account you have one more but you should say I'm in a repeatable read you don't see the other guy doing the insert so you're . 2
10:14:000087:000087_3 : 10:13:18:372: Define deposit for the whole process if your deranged invoicing your Financial Reporting or things like that maybe it's important that your application code only sees the same Snapchat of the data for each and every query is running so that is elation is it it's another part of the as a SEAT dealer and then dribble so do you know this test with the soket plug . 3
10:14:000088:000088_4 : 10:13:45:519: Call a python client that will do I insert into database begin insert commit and the end client code you can't women in society and why the test is running you unplugged the power sockets from the server from the postgresql server in the middle of the district don't like it then you bring it again and I was going to be like over there was a crash I'm going to recover . 4
10:14:000089:000089_1 : 10:14:10:650: Can you do the count again everything you counted in on the client you must have eaten on the server if you don't it's not the rabble . 1
10:14:000090:000090_2 : 10:14:18:596: Whippet rescue if the count don't matter to either because you have a bug in your application you can pick things that we're not known to be committed so you do discount on many times to send the commit message and not to meet and you received it that's the trick or is because it's me some is configured or maybe there is a bug in postgresql that . 2
10:15:000091:000091_3 : 10:14:41:721: Edinburgh to test so it would be surprising that mosquito plug-ins that area and if you think that is not the Ribble . 3
10:15:000092:000092_4 : 10:14:50:867: Maybe throw it away and I set up another one because it's usually not what you want . 4
10:15:000093:000093_1 : 10:14:57:305: So that was a more control and then lets you OK to use that in your application code . 1
10:15:000094:000094_2 : 10:14:58:305: IPhone so . 2
10:15:000095:000095_3 : 10:15:09:677: For the main thing about consistency is that . 3
10:15:000096:000096_4 : 10:15:13:819: Python code the bike and he's going to Employment issues or a walk through so the most of the code you write . 4
10:16:000097:000097_1 : 10:15:20:966: Tied to one use Arduino something . 1
10:16:000098:000098_2 : 10:15:24:797: Have a good way to see to that database management system is that is it going to end of the woods system all the transactions that are happening in parallel are going to be handled into a single system that can be the system of Proof and it's going to implement the business rules and the constraints that you need when you when we think about conference we think that's something that . 2
10:16:000099:000099_3 : 10:15:50:953: hard to handle because nobody wants to have constraints I do want to be free and everyone it's easier so another way to say it is that and then naming them conference you can wear around his . 3
10:16:000100:000100_4 : 10:16:05:093: PGSQL is going to guarantee that the data you put into it makes sense for your application as for your business for your users and for every situation you are so you can say for example in this table makes sense to have . 4
10:17:000101:000101_1 : 10:16:21:240: If there is another one in this other table I want to guarantee the strong guarantee buy this EastEnders whatever I do in the application code this constraint or this reaction to produce a month is true at every time someone that for you and I remember so that's a quote for from the 70s I think . 1
10:17:000102:000102_2 : 10:16:46:384: Rugby . 2
10:18:000103:000103_3 : 10:16:48:521: Were recently I was working a lot in in the early days if Unix in the 70s and did many interesting things in an 80s and 90s and it's about writing code in C in the 70s but it's still true today in 2 minutes if you have to send the right data structures and organise things well the other team will almost be self-evident that does not allow programming in python programming . 3
10:18:000104:000104_4 : 10:17:16:677: You pick your order tax returns on your classes and like to try rights then all the code is going to be so easy to read and maintain that nobody is going to ask questions and just the part of postgresql whether it requires a schema at the Beginning when you don't really know what you're doing your I'd prefer to you know just do some json documents and a cigarette out . 4
10:18:000105:000105_1 : 10:17:37:828: So sometimes it's so boring to say that I need to specify exactly the schema to draw but he provides a lot of clarity about your intention of going to handle and what are the situations do you want to be on Lincoln what are the situation that should not happen in your application you can see all that just by looking at the sequel schema so . 1
10:18:000106:000106_2 : 10:17:59:546: Design your own you coats in terms of data structures or classes in investing what is the same month old model that we can apply to the schema . 2
10:18:000107:000107_3 : 10:18:10:865: Let's hear some examples practical examples with so we going to see lots of data queries on Titan Centre . 3
10:18:000108:000108_4 : 10:18:23:643: I think that because the data is easily available . 4
10:19:000109:000109_1 : 10:18:29:627: Year of the scheme either . 1
10:19:000110:000110_2 : 10:18:32:767: So you said something like that so we are the names . 2
10:19:000111:000111_3 : 10:18:44:913: Text because Carmarthen things to talk but we are are not actually using text you're so the next thing we do is a single alter table statement that is going to change the type of 3 gallons and so it begins and we using this kind of expressions to transfer on the text that are received into something that for postgresql looks like numbers and that you can actually you . 3
10:19:000112:000112_4 : 10:19:10:051: So we knew you could do a 3 . 4
10:19:000113:000113_1 : 10:19:16:191: Sing of Gods into a single Archer table statement so that that mean to enter a single table with white and are using Leica replace substrings and things like that you could use a regular expressions and the splits and whatever so when you would do that in sequel OK when you're so nice so . 1
10:20:000114:000114_2 : 10:19:17:191: I think people called . 2
10:20:000115:000115_3 : 10:19:44:542: Picture of Chloe language and it's a declarative so . 3
10:20:000116:000116_4 : 10:19:50:693: Prolaser programming language right maybe not mean you think of it that way but she called is programming language it happens to be decorative so rather than explaining to the computer how to do the things what you doing sequels you explain the results you want to have . 4
10:20:000117:000117_1 : 10:20:07:829: The result you need and postgresql is going to figure out how to make it happen so one of the things that are difficult for programmers I used to do in programming oriented programming is that they are not having the real this time they just expressing their needs and that's how to do it so when are the equations you really is a . 1
10:21:000118:000118_0 : 10:20:30:981: Implementation is it going is it going to use the Google read them when I do this. Sorry about that . 2
10:21:000119:000119_3 : 10:20:40:591: Can read that maybe can you read out near . 3
10:21:000120:000120_4 : 10:20:46:741: Single event or any reason so we going to take the 10 lines with the bigger numbers so you can see the result on the on the right of the of this idea ok so it's time I want to date on the maximum number and I want the 10 most numbers . 4
10:22:000121:000121_1 : 10:21:08:891: Inviting it easy to do you do if you . 1
10:22:000122:000122_0 : 10:21:13:691: Ok and then you use this method. So it's going to maintain an app off only 10 elements and its time there is a bigger outer element is going to keep it in memory and you only have 10 elements in memory at all times are running the program is to have 1 million lines of input only after 9 that the time in to the doctor ok that's what you want you don't want to load 1 million . 2
10:22:000123:000123_3 : 10:21:39:822: Research them all and then I find out the 10 greatest so you let reading the file and you keep only 10 lines in memory so that if you for you interest and if so you just import if you need to do and at the end you get the 10 largest from the UK so it's really easy to do in Python so . 3
10:22:000124:000124_4 : 10:22:05:613: Google . 4
10:22:000125:000125_1 : 10:22:07:750: It's even easier just say . 1
10:22:000126:000126_2 : 10:22:12:179: Please sort them by your Arsenal won the first then and that's it but . 2
10:23:000127:000127_3 : 10:22:20:327: The Disco the button if you want to do it and seek with you it's done that way you make sure that it's actually going to do the same thing as though he'd sort we implemented by hands before wear if you using postgresql you do an explain . 3
10:23:000128:000128_4 : 10:22:37:480: Brompton bicycle . 4
10:23:000129:000129_1 : 10:22:41:618: Show me the options and Eliza balls and before and then you continue with the career asunder previous light and that's the outside and one of the because it's variables so because it's analyse it going to actually run the query and me are everything and then I give you the answer of this year 1 something music on it and you can sort that used only 25 kilobytes of memory . 1
10:24:000130:000130_2 : 10:23:11:767: Limitations before in Python . 2
10:24:000131:000131_3 : 10:23:15:169: Is that if this amount of memory that you did a top 1000 each other or something like that if it doesn't fit anymore anymore postgresql we know to Spill to disk and then use physical go resin from clothes from the 80s that is called the tape sort and it's going to use that to merge files on disk and Elaine the pain in the right order to drop which would be like complex to write in 5 . 3
10:24:000132:000132_4 : 10:23:43:365: We want to do that but impossible to write a smart algorithm that fitting memory but they speak to this when it asks you at 8 or are you just need to write all devices list that's it that's all you need to do . 4
10:24:000133:000133_1 : 10:23:58:018: Any question so far . 1
10:24:000134:000134_2 : 10:24:01:426: Good . 2
10:24:000135:000135_3 : 10:24:03:558: Tour de . 3
10:24:000136:000136_4 : 10:24:05:694: The first assignment you out with a financial that he dies to do reports so it's a little boring but let's do a monthly report untaxed connect to use it in peace so you can . 4
10:24:000137:000137_1 : 10:24:18:835: This way . 1
10:24:000138:000138_2 : 10:24:20:958: Used to using as a PC call command line just play around with it it's very nice you can even though you have to come and backlash be like you tour and you can associate it to your favourite I don't know you can edit your queries inline NPC clothes using your . 2
10:25:000139:000139_3 : 10:24:43:100: So you can run the query again and again with your friends date and things like that . 3
10:25:000140:000140_4 : 10:24:49:230: So that's a really easy curry right everybody would be able to ride that . 4
10:25:000141:000141_1 : 10:24:57:362: It's really cold 101 and it looks like this so no surprise here . 1
10:25:000142:000142_2 : 10:25:06:499: Of course I speak to worry because otherwise it's not ok and we only have 19 rules for 28 days we have like gaps in your because there were days in the data without activity so maybe we want to feel that licks you that we want the monthly report . 2
10:25:000143:000143_3 : 10:25:27:515: All the days so we bring to use a colander and iterate in the calendar and if there is no data were going to use your right . 3
10:26:000144:000144_4 : 10:25:37:338: It's really a simple python programming and so now we have all the days in February . 4
10:26:000145:000145_1 : 10:25:43:894: When there is no activity . 1
10:26:000146:000146_2 : 10:25:47:024: Can you do that you need to think about something where is that chords going to be used if it's only in one program then sign sure but know if you have that and maybe user dashboard maybe in the admin panel boards may be in the back office make me in the financial and reporting activity may be in several places you need to do the same thing again and again so . 2
10:26:000147:000147_3 : 10:26:12:973: That would be that it would be written directly in the sequel query so do you know how to implement days with no activity in sequel . 3
10:27:000148:000148_4 : 10:26:23:394: Oh dear sorry about that . 4
10:27:000149:000149_1 : 10:26:28:523: So we can tell the rest well please generate 1 months . 1
10:27:000150:000150_2 : 10:26:35:000: With a 1 day interval in between each step of the Surrey CC troops for 1 days type 11 the other day so we said one day from the start to the end in the early start plus 1 month but meanest one day because we don't want to step into March with want to stay in February so that's 1 month is Monday ok so we do it generates a reason we do a Corsa left left join because we want . 2
10:27:000151:000151_3 : 10:27:03:132: I remain a reference people to do what is going to be the days from February and Fourth Estate I'm going to pick up do I have data to go with it if I have I use it and if I don't answer College Avenue . 3
10:27:000152:000152_4 : 10:27:17:991: Your PC Currys . 4
10:27:000153:000153_1 : 10:27:21:324: This function is if I have new as soda you have as many parameters as you want to the function and it will pick the first one of the parameters that is not new . 1
10:27:000154:000154_2 : 10:27:33:469: What is . 2
10:28:000155:000155_3 : 10:27:35:614: Zurich Insurance you also it's true is not know it will keep her as if it's new it will take 0 instead . 3
10:28:000156:000156_4 : 10:27:45:288: We could have written this sequel without in college lecturer in engineering series . 4
10:28:000157:000157_2 : 10:27:53:443: Ok so that's life sequel from the from the 80s guy you could do that thing in the 80s already so if you don't know what to do that you don't know sequel at all it's like it's not even the basics are we going to get into interesting things later but this this thing that you did not even see what it's like any thing in the world so if you don't like sequel but you don't know how to do that . 2
10:29:000158:000158_3 : 10:28:16:563: Like it because you didn't turn out so please learning and then have an opinion but for now you can . 3
10:29:000159:000159_4 : 10:28:23:692: Put the lottery that should be like at snap my fingers like you're all I need to do that contract don't really it's not interesting and the results look like this of course the Weasel Zeros instead of all the numbers when you don't have them and we are the 2128 rules and what nice about it is that you don't need to know that she is only 28 days long is us a 1 month and postgresql . 4
10:29:000160:000160_1 : 10:28:51:825: Put the lottery that should be like at snap my fingers like you're all I need to do that contract don't really it's not interesting and the results look like this of course the Weasel Zeros instead of all the numbers when you don't have them and we are the 2128 rules and what nice about it is that you don't need to know that she is only 28 days long is us Any day is the reason this month because you're going to attack with the plus sign here so when we say that the consistency of the date of the first thing we use for that is the data types . 1
10:30:000161:000161_2 : 10:29:03:087: We are the date and month and then Tyrol sorry and of the plus sign is it in postgresql does a plus sign is it like if you were Victorian tea programming in Python and you have two classes and you implement and operate in between the two classes same thing so depressed nine year is not the same implementation of course if it's two integers or a date on an interval or two . 2
10:30:000162:000162_3 : 10:29:25:221: Ciara the point in a circle or an IP address in an IP address round draw things like that so the subject oriented programming year and you can actually implement run over darling what if you want to and you can't even do that in Python weather API Python if you need to do so first learn sequel but then if you have like if you want to share more code in between your back in . 3
10:31:000163:000163_4 : 10:29:50:346: SQL processing then you can quickly import your Python code directly in your database server if you need to it's easy to do . 4
10:31:000164:000164_1 : 10:30:00:437: Sorry nothing we want from this query and then we're going to be going to begin to do some sequel . 1
10:31:000165:000165_2 : 10:30:08:673: Vbulletin so you can see the result we want like this one day Wednesday we did 10/:/ less than the one before this Wednesday 7th . 2
10:32:000166:000166_4 : 10:31:35:882: It's using a window function . 4
10:32:000167:000167_1 : 10:31:39:698: Lag . 1
10:32:000168:000168_2 : 10:31:41:853: We're going to partition the data by Isabel which means day of week like Monday is one Tuesdays to with strap and a bit of course some people will say that Monday is too because Sunday is one and some people say no you crazy Sunday is your Monday is one so we need to agree on the standard and so there is an easel stand out to figure out which day is which number and so we . 2
10:32:000170:000170_4 : 10:32:12:610: Step behind and one step behind in the dataset is going to be there with the same day of week number is going to be one week before the Wednesday before for example ok so it's really . 4
10:33:000171:000171_0 : 10:32:27:756: Where you can see the data from last week when your processing. Ro when you you could do that in sequel ok that's equal from the 90s this time it's from 90 to 1892 which means that mean . 1
10:33:000172:000172_2 : 10:32:45:903: When they added to the standard ok . 2
10:33:000173:000173_3 : 10:32:51:733: And I've got the results I look like this I just add to colour Ready to copy paste from the terminal I just let you come caress for you to be easier to read . 3
10:33:000174:000174_4 : 10:33:03:538: Foreigner a 92 to the 10th term dates from 2016 and the way to read the number after the sequel naming the song IDS that any person that was issued before that he's consoled it's not valid anymore you if you say equal start . 4
10:33:000175:000175_1 : 10:33:25:678: Other one is deprecated ok so if you know what to do sequel 1999 most people learn sequel when they called 8989 some people are . 1
10:34:000176:000176_2 : 10:33:41:834: NG20 we are too early in 2016 in terms of physical standards ok . 2
10:34:000177:000177_3 : 10:33:48:419: Before you say I don't like sequel and I can do nothing in sequel I need to write back on instead . 3
10:34:000178:000178_4 : 10:33:55:554: Remind about what it means to be doing sequel in like this year is 2018 I guess so maybe sequel from the 80s it's not . 4
10:34:000179:000179_1 : 10:34:06:682: Sold within sequel . 1
10:34:000180:000180_2 : 10:34:09:818: If you were . 2
10:34:000181:000181_3 : 10:34:11:950: We said is a declarative party shopping so if you look at the distance that Unix they say everything is a side it's not exactly true . 3
10:35:000182:000182_4 : 10:34:22:092: He's not well integrated Radio Plus in between two objects in due to the Winter Garden advert it doesn't work activities but they say that everything . 4
10:35:000183:000183_1 : 10:34:36:204: More than just objects or your packages move your glasses that that's the kind of thing you need to think about when you think in terms of Python so how do you want all the thinking in sequel or do you think it's equal you need to think about the relations so what are relations in sequel . 1
10:35:000184:000184_3 : 10:34:52:388: British and it comes from the mass of it right so in mathematics relation is a set of elements that have the same properties that is in circulation is a set of data that are the same . 3
10:36:000185:000185_4 : 10:35:11:518: Domino tributes under the main values . 4
10:36:000186:000186_1 : 10:35:17:671: What he means it's the number of filaments you having to call if you have a need to know if you have only three to 3 people if you don't know the Number 82 portable ok so you have many of them and each one of them you know exactly the type of it and then you have a ball and then you can play with them and say that they are relations . 1
10:36:000187:000187_2 : 10:35:40:820: Electric worry he's going to be a relation ok do the things you do when you wait when you do a select query in sequelize describing the relationship so you have any tricks to say where to pick the data from under the sea liked . 2
10:36:000188:000188_4 : 10:35:58:973: Repeat of the syntax is the prediction query because it describes the output ok it's the projector Prix in operation . 4
10:36:000189:000189_1 : 10:36:07:461: Define the attributes domain when doing that from introduces relations but as we saw before does the front can be a subselect . 1
10:36:000190:000190_2 : 10:36:17:471: The output of a select is a relation and from . 2
10:37:000191:000191_3 : 10:36:22:177: Relations and then what can you do in between relations well you can join them with inner outer and other kind of drugs so who knows the difference between inner and outer join . 3
10:37:000192:000192_4 : 10:36:34:699: When I was about lateral drone joy . 4
10:37:000193:000193_1 : 10:36:39:798: So maybe we'll see that ok and you can also in operation with wheelsets because a relation is almost like a set the main difference is that usually when you have a certain mathematics you don't have to buy . 1
10:37:000194:000194_2 : 10:36:57:930: Nobody cares about duplicate so you may you may have duplicated or you may not have them that's why it's important to have a primary key that is not to say that it doesn't make sense for example as soon as you have a primary key on top of . 2
10:37:000195:000195_3 : 10:37:13:060: That has nothing to do with the data like for example us Ariel games what you don't have a primary key anymore because the fact that just got another one and this one as beautiful as a one and the other one as a to it means nothing about the data so you will have many duplicates but with different numbers at the Beginning nice ok so it's not a penny more in the . 3
10:38:000196:000196_4 : 10:37:36:208: Discovery is just to show a relation so we have a year we use a city called the case that we are going to reuse in from somewhere from . 4
10:38:000197:000197_1 : 10:37:52:347: Can't remember about issues everywhere . 1
10:38:000198:000198_2 : 10:37:57:150: Yes drivers results racing again yes and left join lateral so we have a natural subquery that is using a join the result of the subquery is going to be a relation and lateral allows you to refer the case within the subquery so you can order ready case Ltd Free by Queen somebody going to fetch the three drivers that are the most point in the history of Formula 1 by the . 2
10:38:000199:000199_3 : 10:38:30:301: Look like this so in the fifties 12 unreal . 3
10:39:000200:000200_4 : 10:38:35:437: Jokes . 4
10:39:000201:000201_1 : 10:38:37:572: They're just to say that don't like a fund you come from there . 1
10:39:000202:000202_2 : 10:38:42:442: Sunderland and you can keep roast and maybe tomorrow is more well-known the reason I mean tennis stuff so that's the kind of career you use and so did the front part of the corries introducing relations so every step in the corries a different relation and you can mix and match them together with operators and you hurt her she's like a left join lateral that an operator . 2
10:39:000203:000203_3 : 10:39:03:586: Let's ride strap . 3
10:39:000204:000204_4 : 10:39:07:068: So that's the way to think about a sequel so she got his coat right but rather than explaining the operation in detail what you do is explain the output you want to have in terms of relations that sell your programming sequel . 4
10:39:000205:000205_2 : 10:39:23:232: But if you say that's equally is called when you write Python code you out unit testing integration testing maybe you are . 2
10:40:000206:000206_4 : 10:39:32:541: Ring around the fact that you write Python so can you have that in there a sequel . 4
10:40:000207:000207_1 : 10:39:39:691: Console . 1
10:40:000208:000208_2 : 10:39:42:012: The thing that I like to do is when I do when I used cycling in an application is that I'm using cicode Files write your files that are food that guy because it's the forecast in Plymouth uni Python so I fell into my source code . 2
10:40:000209:000209_3 : 10:40:00:136: It's good to I don't want to want to be handling like strings . 3
10:40:000210:000210_4 : 10:40:05:242: They play run with an n son to postgresql it's a very bad way to write code . 4
10:40:000211:000211_1 : 10:40:12:403: So you would have a pay for a sequel phone like this but no you want to do as unit testing regression testing you want to have parameters you want to have xcode right . 1
10:40:000212:000212_2 : 10:40:24:198: You can use a new sequel as there are other Solutions but it's the way to find a silly and picked . 2
10:40:000213:000213_3 : 10:40:33:105: If the . 3
10:41:000214:000214_4 : 10:40:35:750: If you have this file used eco file you see there are two Coreys there with her they have a . 4
10:41:000215:000215_1 : 10:40:42:651: Well it's really easy query I'm at the venue going to be there no sequel to can run the queries and then use them by the name as if there were some samples and you got to give them arguments and parameters and things . 1
10:41:000216:000216_2 : 10:40:57:777: So it's really easy to until she calling to your Source Code and where did it and then you can have a diff and you can review a pull request where are you overdose on the sequel and you can think about it it's not just a different beans to string differently and it has no meaning and you don't know what to compare adjust the difference between two equal sides it's going to be . 2
10:41:000217:000217_0 : 10:41:17:925: How to undo and
10:42:000218:000218_4 : 10:41:24:054: Maison . 4
10:42:000219:000219_1 : 10:41:26:195: Those internally for its owner regression testing you're a very simple you have queries and parameters so you run the queries with the Commodores and you check that the output is the same as the one that is expected so it's really really easy to implement and it looks like this when you using it so you are expected I would and plants drought areas in the plans you have yellow . 1
10:42:000220:000220_2 : 10:41:50:353: Things to parameters that you want to associate with the chorus because you are either fighting sequel that can handle parameters and then you have the expected signs when you run PC quality of it so you rent if you have a you say . 2
10:42:000221:000221_0 : 10:42:10:469: And then you run degrees are getting a new you do a difference between the output that was expected on the output directory as so your brother contestants that's it it's really you can do that like in half an hour and bass on if you want so just for Kicks on FIFA implemented eating go because I wanted to see what he will be like to
10:43:000222:000222_4 : 10:42:30:638: I got no weed in the day you have it . 4
10:43:000223:000223_2 : 10:42:33:987: Sequel as code including in your idiot or supports because you know you are there a sequel fires and regression testing and chips and it's writing your daily programmer life . 2
10:43:000224:000224_3 : 10:42:53:832: Any question so far we're going to see more interesting sequel now . 3
10:43:000225:000225_4 : 10:42:59:653: So why I told you that im possible so we have 72 different data types by default so maybe that's not enough so let's hear some of the ones . 4
10:43:000226:000226_1 : 10:43:12:792: Easy to install an extension and then play around with it . 1
10:44:000227:000227_0 : 10:43:16:913: When extension. I like is IP addresses round so did you know you could do to your location with a single logical query . 2
10:44:000228:000228_3 : 10:43:27:056: So that that is my IP address and is operator so it looks of it all going right it looks trans but if you think about it using greater than sign or equal sign it something that doesn't make any sense to just that we got used to it right the fact that we used to Alton Towers to say that values are equal to each other and something . 3
10:44:000229:000229_4 : 10:43:52:187: So the way to read news when is contains the IP range contains is IP address ok . 4
10:44:000230:000230_1 : 10:44:01:430: And just with that you're going to have a Joe location where is so maybe you're thinking about that I can do that in the python coding the interweb back and I have many back and sit easy to spin up new server if I have so more load why you would I do that in sequel well maybe you have made it that are that you want to associate with the IP address like we do here we actually use . 1
10:44:000231:000231_2 : 10:44:28:577: And we join against another table with more data . 2
10:45:000232:000232_3 : 10:44:33:059: What we could do to is the computer distance in between a boy . 3
10:45:000233:000233_4 : 10:44:38:179: Another one so let's say that this is an IP address you may be the one of your phone right now or your computer . 4
10:45:000234:000234_1 : 10:44:49:099: And you're going to use that and you're going to find the Ender story find every pub around like The Descent Elizabeth so it security . 1
10:45:000235:000235_2 : 10:45:03:223: And supporters Maria tran surname she's expecting from openstreetmap project Free TV to fetch in Upper Street the list of all the pubs in France or out for you that's first for a conference in Ireland in Dublin so I loaded all the birds from . 2
10:45:000236:000236_3 : 10:45:22:353: And supporters Maria tran surname she's expecting from openstreetmap Project Free TV to fetch in Upper Street the list of all the pubs in France or out for you that's first for a conference in Ireland in Dublin so And the IP address for the IP address that you got in your tail of the conference and it is the greatest simple security . 3
10:45:000237:000237_4 : 10:45:32:604: And you have the list of pubs around with the distance in miles it is just a sequel query . 4
10:45:000238:000238_1 : 10:45:41:750: And . 1
10:45:000239:000239_2 : 10:45:43:881: And agree that the truth . 2
10:45:000240:000240_3 : 10:45:47:999: You're testing . 3
10:46:000241:000241_4 : 10:45:51:141: Come out your . 4
10:46:000242:000242_1 : 10:45:54:268: Strong . 1
10:46:000243:000243_2 : 10:45:56:391: Product it means that you're going to have as many lines as the first table x the number of lines of the other tables you going to do a full Cartesian product of the Two tables but it's ok why . 2
10:46:000244:000244_3 : 10:46:11:714: Xindak table with IP ranges . 3
10:47:000245:000245_4 : 10:46:16:026: The constraint impossible squirrel that you can implement that says that that forbids to have overlapping runs is so I didn't put on the slides to hear how to write it but it's in the documentation is really easy to find so you can have a table containing all the IP ranges that are given to you by your educatgeolocationion provider and you can say to postgresql at the range is your . 4
10:47:000246:000246_1 : 10:46:39:214: They are so we don't hear and read only tune IP address for The Range is that we are in the database . 1
10:47:000247:000247_2 : 10:46:46:308: I have a guarantee that they are not overlapping which means that Discovery because we have a single IP address is going to return a single rooms we know that because there is no overlap allowed so any given IP address on the heating to 1 runs that's what it means that you have a constraint that there is no overlaping ranges and that's why I told you that constraint . 2
10:47:000248:000248_3 : 10:47:07:437: Think about them it's guarantees you have a guaranteed to strong guarantee that this where is going to win 10 . 3
10:48:000249:000249_4 : 10:47:18:585: 1 rules which means that covers and protects you that's not a problem because you x 1 . 4
10:48:000250:000250_1 : 10:47:26:496: Much right . 1
10:48:000251:000251_2 : 10:47:29:465: Did you order by and limit if you would you explain of the courier you would see that it's implemented using what we call the KNN search UK is the number error code is 10 and nn8 for nearest neighbours so we want the nearest neighbours and so when you write other buy this one is in a metre distance to order by distance limit is implemented into a single index scan and . 2
10:48:000252:000252_3 : 10:48:00:614: Who's going to stand in Wrexham order and only the index can you going to be used to be able to order buyer position the distance in between the position of the pub and your location to meet then it's a single index scan . 3
10:48:000253:000253_4 : 10:48:16:505: Efficient . 4
10:48:000254:000254_1 : 10:48:18:699: Lovely kind of thing you can do in postgres not even a week without extension your way using two extension the one that knows how to do . 1
10:49:000255:000255_2 : 10:48:29:834: Operation in between IP ranges and IP addresses and the other one is called the Earth distance and it's pretty to providing this distance operator that is expressed in miles without it . 2
10:49:000256:000256_3 : 10:48:41:980: We would use only this one but it would be on there like a Cartesian distance because you are coordinates and you'd like but you didn't end in across room . 3
10:49:000257:000257_4 : 10:48:52:143: And you would have a like your number is it doesn't mean anything but with your assistance the two points are actually considered as a location on the Earth and then you can see directors fear and then you do the more complex calculation and because an American did it you have the resulting nice but it is to convert m to kilometres in ok . 4
10:49:000258:000258_1 : 10:49:12:042: Another one that I did like his . 1
10:49:000259:000259_2 : 10:49:15:165: It's from the mother to be article where there were also happy to show that they're there no add aggregate so when you hear about that produce for example that produces a kind of an aggregator creating equal in the seventies already ok so . 2
10:50:000260:000260_3 : 10:49:33:307: Stop it and the optical was really long and full of examples and things and they said so this is a quote from the article interesting fact the registrar so it's really important defensive rebounds . 3
10:50:000261:000261_4 : 10:49:52:940: Tries to score the point and . 4
10:50:000262:000262_1 : 10:49:57:088: Im getting to it and then he goes out but then you pick the ball from the opponent and you score so it's really very good statistics for a basketball when you follow it and that sound as they said this interesting fact . 1
10:50:000263:000263_2 : 10:50:12:229: The aggregate query that you wouldn't need to run to find it so it was a juicer price on like a little bit in sequel . 2
10:50:000264:000264_3 : 10:50:19:520: The set of all the games for the word story of the NBA it's open data you can find that and ok today dies in Jason and I didn't realise it . 3
10:51:000265:000265_4 : 10:50:34:657: Strange but anyway just for Blood by jang ready . 4
10:51:000266:000266_1 : 10:50:43:787: Fish from the gate does the start of the games the team that hosts the guest I'm going to find them see who wins and here we going to find . 1
10:52:000267:000267_2 : 10:50:55:732: See the moon over nothing it's a window function to be so that before so it means that you will get Ender quarry every line but also with every line you will see the minimum number of defensive rebounds R/:/B the difference so the meaning of them that is output from the . 2
10:52:000268:000268_3 : 10:51:16:870: NBA in the kids and then you can see a show me all the games with the statistics that are the minimum number of differences Ribbons if I go back one side you say it's exactly the question that is asked you so I just know that is written in English this is the same thing written in sequel that that's about it so when you have a struggle writing a sequel query tried to . 3
10:52:000269:000269_4 : 10:51:43:024: Single sentence in your native language because it is you're making it into a single sentence if you can make it into a single sentence than writing the secret is going to be easy and it was the 36/4 games the minimum number of runs is 14 and there are four days that happens to a number of different reasons and the team that won the game so I don't know what . 4
10:52:000270:000270_1 : 10:52:11:172: But if you was progress credit is really easy to do and you have the result of fast enough see you for the movie story of the NBA . 1
10:52:000271:000271_2 : 10:52:20:310: And to finish the . 2
10:52:000272:000272_3 : 10:52:26:322: Sunseeker careers that I like this one Instagram . 3
10:53:000273:000273_4 : 10:52:32:454: So she gave it to you to read it again . 4
10:53:000274:000274_1 : 10:52:36:757: You know about MVC model view controller so you can do that into your sequel if you want to that's the model that is a controller That I Love You So the model 36 from the game . 1
10:53:000275:000275_2 : 10:52:51:433: Do you hear is Sir it's going to be a like a horizontal bar is to run better because the side of the screen is not so why did so I only have 30 days to review and the controller . 2
10:53:000276:000276_3 : 10:53:11:236: I'm using is a with bucket so I'm going to have Instagram but you know what that works is to run right you are like when you go to the market and you buy tomatoes are apples depending on the size of the Apple there are in different baskets right because there are there is no international normal size of the Opera . 3
10:54:000277:000277_4 : 10:53:34:380: Container on the others of the same category write to same thing . 4
10:54:000278:000278_1 : 10:53:41:530: The numbers of different Ribbons that you have in a in a game so most of the games in the NBA history between 25 and 35 differences Ribbons ok . 1
10:54:000279:000279_2 : 10:53:54:677: Super Glue that you can see you're so you can do that like in a couple minutes of course nobody is going to write that I like it when sitting so you're going to write maybe if that first and then are you going to play around with this because I take some time to have it exactly right and then maybe you don't know how to make an integral around with different values include one as . 2
10:54:000280:000280_3 : 10:54:20:875: And then you would buy bucket so you need to do something with locators Russell there is a lot of playing around with it but then you . 3
10:55:000281:000281_4 : 10:54:31:983: You play around with joining the other parts of the queries together and etc and then you have that is enough like you have lunch break like 5-minutes and you have a nice sized Duran Duran like advances or whatever to do the drawing for you when you know it's easy . 4
10:55:000282:000282_1 : 10:54:53:116: Any questions . 1
10:55:000283:000283_2 : 10:54:55:489: I want to ask me a question I I I like question so who wants to ask questions . 2
10:55:000284:000284_3 : 10:55:01:485: Yes . 3
10:55:000285:000285_4 : 10:55:06:636: I'm going to try to pick the slide . 4
10:55:000286:000286_1 : 10:55:16:900: This one . 1
10:55:000287:000287_2 : 10:55:20:032: Today . 2
10:55:000288:000288_3 : 10:55:24:169: Yeah so I need to repeat the question because for the recording . 3
10:56:000289:000289_4 : 10:55:30:321: You're using so what does it mean to join using so it means that the name of the guys it's what you were you guessed the name of the Colonial kg exist in both tables Bloxham location so rather than two blocks location that look at the ideas using . 4
10:56:000290:000290_1 : 10:55:51:528: Same thing it's another way to write it so it's nice . 1
10:56:000291:000291_2 : 10:55:57:638: The great dark in your code you need to make sure that everybody in the team knows about it otherwise they are they will have no difficulty with you in it and they will not like you because they need to learn some more because I can before they can we do the patch so depending on your team difference that . 2
10:56:000292:000292_3 : 10:56:12:790: Another question . 3
10:56:000293:000293_4 : 10:56:16:924: Yes so the question is using you just eat feta if you wanted to macro that is going to be expended . 4
10:56:000294:000294_1 : 10:56:17:924: Find the Two tables that have the same account name . 1
10:57:000295:000295_2 : 10:56:33:810: So they don't you ever ever message back . 2
10:57:000296:000296_3 : 10:56:38:247: Yes . 3
10:57:000297:000297_4 : 10:56:42:370: Yes so the question is about using Python code in the back-end in postgresql itself so it's called the pl fighting and you have to version of it's appeal in your past credit means programming language or pluggable language you can plug in your programming language whereabouts in postgresql create extension build python eating and then you can write Python code that is executor . 4
10:58:000298:000298_1 : 10:57:11:519: In the context of a query so I've been using that before in very specific circumstances when project for example we greeted data . 1
10:58:000299:000299_2 : 10:57:22:658: The user so it was a little crazy but because they used bicycles I didn't have much processing for were so they did they sterilize Folkestone to put a gif format into the database and so the database on the attic and ID and the port above which contains three columns actually it was completely crazy and so what I did is load binary data into postgresql and then right . 2
10:58:000300:000300_3 : 10:57:47:813: Vitamin A function that with this I realise the photograph later and then I could use that to transfer to the real cause list all tables so in some cases it's really nice to use another I use cases when you want to import some code that you wrote in Python already and you want to use it for example in a join like this you could join and use the Euro an operator that you wrote . 3
10:59:000301:000301_4 : 10:58:09:920: Because it is eating the back and code and there now it makes sense in postgresql and so you could export Python library and use it as possible to an operator and it works pretty nice . 4
10:59:000302:000302_1 : 10:58:26:524: The thing I would say about it is the first make sure that it's really hard or impossible to do in sequel to do it and sequel and if it fails or and or if you actually very much need the same code to run as in the earlier the back-end application maybe see your photo pl python . 1
10:59:000303:000303_2 : 10:58:47:649: Do we have them for another question that one wants to ask the last question . 2
10:59:000304:000304_4 : 10:59:03:726: Yeah that's a very nice question I love it so . 4
10:59:000305:000305_1 : 10:59:14:854: So the question is which book would I recommend to answer call and for those of you guys because it's morning . 1
10:59:000306:000306_2 : 10:59:24:988: Just want you guys . 2
10:59:000307:000307_3 : 10:59:28:103: A little bit before to use . 3
11:04:000308:000308_4 : 10:59:32:243: How to use this field right . 4
11:04:000309:000309_1 : 10:59:36:456: That wasn't very very very nice the last question . 1
11:04:000310:000310_2 : 10:59:42:586: Remember sofa beds are . 2

11:04:000311:000311_4 : 11:04:02:020: Alizée même harmonisant application donc je pars . 4
11:04:000312:000312_1 : 11:04:09:199: Qui est vrai pour moi mais qui peut l'être . 1
11:04:000313:000313_2 : 11:04:13:324: Aujourd'hui sur ce constat pour ça va être le fil rouge . 2
11:04:000314:000314_3 : 11:04:17:461: Aujourd'hui sur son sac Le prix d'un développeur . 3
11:04:000315:000315_4 : 11:04:22:183: J'entends par infrastructure . 4
11:05:000316:000316_1 : 11:04:29:062: Le serveur donc au niveau de l' hardware vraiment Danny dreige le réseau ou même une base de données donc finalement tout ce qui est utilisé pour votre application un peu python je prends un exemple qui peut peut-être parler à certains d'entre vous . 1
11:05:000317:000317_2 : 11:04:45:200: Petite API Python qui marche plutôt bien fait aucun souci . 2
11:05:000318:000318_3 : 11:04:51:344: Une semaine j'avais des lenteurs toutes les minutes toutes les 5 minutes vous avez une requête qui met 60 secondes . 3
11:05:000319:000319_4 : 11:04:58:969: Si jamais il y a pas de problème Élodie de mon chien a un problème vous allez voir la personne la plus proche de Vouglans DevOps une personne de me poser la question . 4
11:05:000320:000320_1 : 11:05:12:103: Il va vous rediriger une fois sur deux un bon bah c'est le réseau vous avoir le réseau le réseau est complètement perdu . 1
11:05:000321:000321_2 : 11:05:25:227: Crèche un peu méchant avec les gens du réseau . 2
11:05:000322:000322_3 : 11:05:29:367: Il est bien configurer mon Tennessee passe . 3
11:06:000323:000323_4 : 11:05:34:497: Vous avoir le DBA ou la DBA vous dis non Moinerie son bonne santé courir . 4
11:06:000324:000324_1 : 11:05:43:795: Savoir . 1
11:06:000325:000325_2 : 11:05:45:855: Vraiment je grossis un peu le trait mais je suis sur certains d'entre vous ont vécu 7 7 épisode W toujours dans une moindre mesure c'est extrêmement frustrant pour la personne qui développe la pays et ça va entraîner dans l'équipe donc . 2
11:06:000326:000326_3 : 11:06:03:985: Pour voir comment finalement on peut expliquer pourquoi aujourd'hui on peut vis enfin moi je l'ai vécu et pourquoi il existe une règle . 3
11:06:000327:000327_4 : 11:06:16:874: Moi c'est que le sais point de vue finalement chaque équipe non regarde pas la même chose on peut avoir le même produit . 4
11:06:000329:000329_2 : 11:06:30:152: Au pire on l'a choses différemment . 2
11:07:000330:000330_3 : 11:06:34:274: On entend beaucoup parler le monitoring tout ce qui est black box /:/ White Box aujourd'hui l'infrastructure pour un développeur c'est très souvent vu comme une blague box j'avais très peu de visibilité . 3
11:07:000331:000331_4 : 11:06:47:424: A contrario finalement l'infrastructure vu comme une voix de boxe . 4
11:07:000332:000332_1 : 11:06:53:551: Beaucoup de choses vous êtes très très distant finalement du produit ou de l'abbaye pour qu'on a vraiment de monde qui s'opposent qui ont du mal un peu à se parler ou finalement à travaillan sans . 1
11:07:000333:000333_0 : 11:07:04:695: . polystyrène liste non exhaustive mais c'est ce que j'aime moi c'est ce que je pense être intéressant en général aujourd'hui le point de vue du développeur sur toi engineer . 2
11:07:000334:000334_3 : 11:07:16:817: Oh pour les dents important je response time tout ce qu'il attend seulement exemple de la très bon . 3
11:07:000335:000335_4 : 11:07:25:960: Tu as fait ok . 4
11:07:000336:000336_1 : 11:07:28:095: Black Box et voilà c'est . 1
11:07:000337:000337_2 : 11:07:32:247: Ça doit tourner je veux juste des ressources . 2
11:08:000338:000338_3 : 11:07:37:373: Au niveau de la consistance si je parle pas de la donner mais plutôt être quelque chose de consistant et de correct . 3
11:08:000339:000339_4 : 11:07:46:518: Fond de moi j'ai pas touché mon code ça va rester flat ayant un impact . 4
11:08:000340:000340_1 : 11:07:52:651: A contrario le point de vue Laz sysadmin Houdain DBA exetera Paris 10 c pas exhaustifs mais ça va être très différent on va plutôt en avoir une vision assez bas niveau . 1
11:08:000341:000341_2 : 11:08:04:798: Comment comment finalement mon serveur se comporte quand j serveur j'embarque bar métal conteneurs et au niveau de la capacité finalement à monter en charge un aspect financier . 2
11:08:000342:000342_3 : 11:08:22:940: Compte que finalement chacun de regarde pas la même chose . 3
11:09:000343:000343_4 : 11:08:29:084: Elle n'a pas la même affinité . 4
11:09:000344:000344_1 : 11:08:33:394: Et donc finalement quand on a un petit souci . 1
11:09:000345:000345_2 : 11:08:37:864: Tu as passé . 2
11:09:000346:000346_3 : 11:09:08:674: Saisissez juste pour qu'on soit d'accord mais finalement les résultats c'est leur comme il a assez difficile à prévoir une recherche à une autre d'une personne à une autre ça va être quasiment . 3
11:09:000347:000347_4 : 11:09:22:731: Pamela même réponse . 4
11:10:000348:000348_1 : 11:09:26:865: Vous avez un souci sur une API ou sur une Alfa à automatiser la recherche google pour une réponse et là c'est moi qui m'intéresse le plus c'est au niveau des gens on peut pas finalement en dehors des légendes à mon travail ensemble avec ce genre de débat . 1
11:10:000349:000349_2 : 11:09:46:917: Donc le but c'est de descendre un peu des méthodologies plus ou moins vieille on va en voir trois qui sont assez récente et qui sort de . 2
11:10:000350:000350_3 : 11:09:58:558: Une petite 4e qui peut tout le monde mon expérience le but c'est pas de vous donner une liste de de technologie va pas aller . 3
11:10:000351:000351_4 : 11:10:07:699: Amuse-toi voir une approche et on va assez bien aussi documentaire au niveau de . 4
11:10:000352:000352_1 : 11:10:16:830: Rentrée énormément détails mais c'est plutôt est capable de donner une nouvelle view de chaque méthodologie et puis maman quel problème à la essayer d'adresser ou avec comment vous pouvez l'utiliser . 1
11:10:000353:000353_2 : 11:10:27:592: La méthode qu'on va avoir toujours moins connu la méthode yeux . 2
11:10:000354:000354_3 : 11:10:35:747: 3 méthodes et on verra à la rentrée mais on va chacun dans la . 3
11:11:000355:000355_4 : 11:10:39:897: Intéressant tu vas pouvoir surtout vous aider à organiser un peu cadrer autant le monitoring . 4
11:11:000356:000356_1 : 11:10:49:032: Je pense que je parle people ça va être un aussi une manière de choses . 1
11:11:000357:000357_2 : 11:10:58:187: Crée des ponts technologie contre l'équipe ça pour moi c'est la chose la plus importante et c'est le vecteur friction que je connais le plus capable d'utiliser un aussi mais tu sais même aussi finalement entre les équipes pour avoir la même façon de regarder . 2
11:11:000358:000358_3 : 11:11:12:336: Moi comment se faire méthode . 3
11:11:000359:000359_4 : 11:11:16:469: Ressources et regarder utilisation la saturation importante . 4
11:11:000360:000360_1 : 11:11:23:614: La météo du jour c'était . 1
11:11:000361:000361_2 : 11:11:28:737: Qui ai fait ça finalement beaucoup pour la base de données . 2
11:12:000362:000362_3 : 11:11:35:545: Je pense que c'est une dérange pas pu voir heureusement que c'est une des briques applicative les moins compris soirée développeur . 3
11:12:000363:000363_4 : 11:11:44:685: Parce qu'on s'y intéresse pas ou parce qu'on a pas aussi qu'on a des sushis une méthode pour appliquer pour trouver un moyen de trafic . 4
11:12:000364:000364_1 : 11:11:55:830: Terminologie Sandero source de . 1
11:12:000365:000365_2 : 11:12:01:169: Il y a 47 mois site web sur le juge méthode . 2
11:12:000366:000366_3 : 11:12:06:308: Oui comment ça a été apportée . 3
11:12:000367:000367_4 : 11:12:09:449: Revenir cette méthode c'est que voilà c'est très bon anniv aujourd'hui c'est surtout surtout ce qui . 4
11:12:000368:000368_1 : 11:12:16:587: Brick . 1
11:12:000369:000369_2 : 11:12:18:731: La saturation et les Orres SFR ça finalement sur chaque sur chaque brick . 2
11:13:000370:000370_3 : 11:12:25:872: Recherche messages et c'est un peu . 3
11:13:000371:000371_4 : 11:12:30:356: Bac en faite méthode j'essaie de faire c'est mon avis mais en plus c'est un mois et finalement si vous voulez le matériel à quoi ressemblerait cette méthode aller à ces vieilles elle est assez utiliser mon quel avons fait ses preuves sur du debeing beaucoup de base de données c'est très très utile il y a beaucoup de . 4
11:13:000372:000372_1 : 11:12:49:485: Chats qui savaient que maman a flight plan ou qui explique que je regarde le sais plus comment je le regarde comment je vais regarder finalement les 10 exetera et ça vous pouvez le donner s'il ment à toutes vos équipes une fois vous avez a checklist et en existe finalement disponible sur internet donc . 1
11:13:000373:000373_2 : 11:13:05:638: Je suis intéressé à moi ce que j'aime beaucoup dans la méthode UC que ça permet finalement the white Boxx et les ressources de votre infrastructure vous avez des centaines de serveur capable de donner un . 2
11:13:000374:000374_3 : 11:13:20:776: Un peu ce qui se passe sur les serveurs que tu peux laisser cette méthode je peux te fournir un dashboard l'intégrer à ton droit de gros point noir aujourd'hui gros point négatif c'est finalement ça niveau hardware . 3
11:14:000375:000375_4 : 11:13:35:924: Développeurs n'est pas la main donc si finalement à vous d'être sûrement la demander au réseau steam d'infrastructure de vous fournir cette . 4
11:14:000376:000376_0 : 11:13:43:472: c'est que c'est pas ses parents tes services c'est vraiment beaucoup orienter le serveur ça te fait beaucoup pour les serveurs c'est pas très facilement adaptable . 1
11:14:000377:000377_2 : 11:13:53:625: Les méthodes ça m'étonnerait à qui elle ce qui est important pour moi donc c'est pour ça que service mon bain monitor il reste . 2
11:14:000378:000378_3 : 11:14:03:410: Donc là m'étonnerait temps fait à il vraiment orientée services et quand on dit service et finalement une abbaye . 3
11:14:000379:000379_4 : 11:14:11:253: En terme de terminologie on va le voir mais ça c'est le nom de rail donc le nombre de requêtes qu'on reçoit le nombre d'erreurs quand est-ce qui est un dû passer roquette et le temps que prendre contre les méthodes par fois pour la même pour la même chose il y a toujours . 4
11:15:000380:000380_1 : 11:14:32:383: Latency où ça dépend . 1
11:15:000381:000381_2 : 11:14:36:538: Derrière la méthode red finalement si on se rend compte tout de suite que c'est beaucoup plus orienté API orientée services que hardware pas vraiment d'avoir une vision assez rapide de qu'est-ce qui se passe sur mon appli . 2
11:15:000382:000382_3 : 11:14:51:450: C'est ce que j'ai dit voilà c'est beaucoup des années pour les développeurs ça parle beaucoup plus au développeur est capable d'avoir ces informations que le côté le lot de mon serveur qui finalement on est assez distante ça pour ça que ça intéresse un peu de ski et ses services et services l'objectif . 3
11:15:000383:000383_0 : 11:15:12:593: C'est un très très bon. Commencé comme c'est très proche finalement de une application business on est capable de donner finalement le paye mon âme la latence à votre client qui vous veut c'est sûr peut-être des enfants un peu assez important de vous avoir une réponse à la . 4
11:15:000384:000384_1 : 11:15:30:741: Auprès de votre client par exemple à répondre 99 /:/ du temps . 1
11:16:000385:000385_2 : 11:15:37:877: Et si vous dépassez vous avez des pénalités . 2
11:16:000386:000386_3 : 11:15:41:928: Finalement derrière qui va se mettre Alizée si il faut vous ayez des indicateurs et en fait cette méthode vraiment vraiment adapté a été popularisé . 3
11:16:000387:000387_4 : 11:15:51:063: Microservices Dutti finalement qui sont Plug and Play pour votre service mes idées derrière . 4
11:16:000388:000388_1 : 11:16:00:197: Le point de cette méthode si on peut dire c'est un problème c'est que ça . 1
11:16:000389:000389_2 : 11:16:07:357: Homme que la cause . 2
11:16:000390:000390_0 : 11:16:10:509: En fait je t'attends ce je sais pas pourquoi j'ai un bon. . 3
11:16:000391:000391_4 : 11:16:15:651: Très difficile de trouver la route . 4
11:16:000392:000392_1 : 11:16:19:792: Écoutez c'est pas une solution . 1
11:16:000393:000393_2 : 11:16:23:918: Mais c'est l'ensemble de ces solutions qui va vous permettre finalement d'adresser beaucoup de problématique . 2
11:17:000394:000394_3 : 11:16:31:959: Paris elle est un peu on a beaucoup parlé parce que finalement c'était dans le bouquin de google je vous invite au fait demain sur des systèmes distribués . 3
11:17:000395:000395_4 : 11:16:46:099: Bouquin de Google c Reebok vraiment une mine d'or pour ton vraiment vraiment vite s'il voulait rien . 4
11:17:000396:000396_1 : 11:16:55:252: Donc l'idée c'était comment on peut monitorer jusqu'à et systèmes distribués quel indicateur on peut utiliser . 1
11:17:000397:000397_2 : 11:17:03:397: Beaucoup trop de la de la méthode la méthode red ils ont juste ajouter la notion de saturation . 2
11:17:000398:000398_3 : 11:17:10:554: Commentaires sont la saturation la situation pour ceux qui . 3
11:17:000399:000399_4 : 11:17:15:688: Capable de dire finalement mon à payer appeler Jérémy request pars seulement et si vous arrivez à me sens que finalement vous avez . 4
11:17:000400:000400_1 : 11:17:24:829: Une Alfa une brique hardware ceinture se mettre le disque . 1
11:18:000401:000401_2 : 11:17:31:968: Quelque chose saturé finalement va entraîner parfois des erreurs ou la latence que c'était super intéressant . 2
11:18:000402:000402_3 : 11:17:39:614: Donc ce que j'ai testé par Google vraiment il le pousse une amende aussi dans certains outils qui développe par d'autres boîtes aussi il y a pas besoin d'avoir . 3
11:18:000403:000403_4 : 11:17:52:751: Le bouquin parce que j'ai assez intéressant et c'est pas non plus révolutionnaire c'est juste la méthode respiration donc c'est pas important . 4
11:18:000404:000404_1 : 11:18:03:893: Comme des médecins CDA proches qui sont après qui se marie souvent sous forme de métrique c'est pour ça que je m'étais un petit déjeuner . 1
11:18:000405:000405_2 : 11:18:13:042: Transformers papiers avant une chat qui se savoir qu'est-ce que comment je peux regarder . 2
11:19:000406:000406_3 : 11:18:17:972: La méthode qui pour moi a le plus de sens c'est la notation cirque aujourd'hui la on a vu quelques petites méthode qui vont permettre d'identifier des causes des choses qui est très dur finalement corréler les choses . 3
11:19:000407:000407_4 : 11:18:33:118: On se rencontre souvent à moi j'ai déjà été confronté à des soucis où on a des serveurs Windows pour faire une TPO faire BNS est le père de la personne change le serveur NTP et donc on arrive un souci et on mettra en fait pour comprendre que c'est que c'est Gérard qu'à changer de DNS parce qu'il y a un moment il y a une communication . 4
11:19:000408:000408_1 : 11:18:55:255: Mon corps est la . 1
11:19:000409:000409_2 : 11:18:57:895: Tonton tout ce que vous faites a autant de business métier de faire des annotations je vais vous montrer . 2
11:19:000410:000410_3 : 11:19:06:043: On fait un déploiement il faut le dire où faut le mettre dans un système quand vous avez un accident il faut le mettre où on fait une maintenance quand même très bas comme un démon Arista faut pas avoir peur c'est vraiment . 3
11:20:000412:000412_2 : 11:19:31:505: Présentation pour est corrélé très rapidement un problème qui vous prends à 3h en fait en cinq minutes vous rendez compte que c'est juste une personne café quelque chose . 2
11:20:000413:000413_3 : 11:19:40:628: Fais à tous les niveaux dire que l'ajout d'un client a un impact sur votre infrastructure si vous avez un client qui arrive qui ajoute 10 million de request par jour c'est sûr peut-être que ça va casse vos SLI/SLO le finalement vous allez à saturer technique ajouter un nouveau serveur . 3
11:20:000414:000414_4 : 11:20:01:771: Retirer c'est important de savoir . 4
11:20:000415:000415_1 : 11:20:05:682: Pareil aussi pour ceux qui ont ça des structures un peu plus santé équipe où chacun responsable par exemple . 1
11:20:000416:000416_2 : 11:20:12:820: Une partie de l'infrastructure par exemple . 2
11:20:000417:000417_3 : 11:20:17:964: Ah si finalement vous faites quelque chose sur vos plateforme ça facilite énormément le travail cross équipe donc c'est intéressant il y a pas la notation finalement c'est obligé de automatisé eau manuelle . 3
11:21:000418:000418_4 : 11:20:34:094: C'est pas obligé d'avoir un système full automatique pour dire non moi je sais pas automatique je passe à la main ou pas commencé à faire de la natation à la main . 4
11:21:000419:000419_2 : 11:20:43:261: Et dans le temps aussi c'est assez intéressant c'est pas grave si finalement natation vous la faites maintenant et ça s'est passé il y a 2 semaines c'est vraiment pas le c'est pas la notion de . 2
11:21:000420:000420_0 : 11:20:54:417: Waouh. Charles . 3
11:21:000421:000421_4 : 11:20:58:558: Dentiste une chose ça c'est un an d'annotation sur une plate-forme pour machine One Berlin . 4
11:21:000422:000422_1 : 11:21:06:692: C'est un an d'annotation ne sais pas ça fait assez gros . 1
11:21:000423:000423_2 : 11:21:12:839: Vraiment vraiment très utile grafana pour ce t'ai pas reconnu . 2
11:21:000424:000424_3 : 11:21:18:994: Métrique de mettre une petite annotation qui dit . 3
11:22:000425:000425_4 : 11:21:19:994: Donc je sais pas si on voit bien finalement là c'est juste des erreurs sur des serveurs qu'on a la petite et notation c'est juste le déploiement d'un code et en fait on s'est aperçu que 10 minutes plus tard ça je n'avais pas grave mais très rapidement . 4
11:22:000426:000426_1 : 11:21:43:281: Je me sens pendant les bénéfices finalement . 1
11:22:000427:000427_2 : 11:21:52:418: Le feed-back aussi être capable de voir ce qui s'est passé et ça fait si tu me mens la communication . 2
11:22:000428:000428_3 : 11:22:01:549: Par un chat peut importe mais après ça ça ouvre la discussion par contre ça demande donc CSDPS . 3
11:22:000429:000429_4 : 11:22:16:667: Récemment grafana je gère aussi maintenant les invitations . 4
11:22:000430:000430_1 : 11:22:23:796: Je sais pas comment germer saisir directement grâce à . 1
11:22:000431:000431_2 : 11:22:28:538: Voilà pour faire un petit take away rapide . 2
11:23:000432:000432_3 : 11:22:34:263: Très très important j'en parle beaucoup . 3
11:23:000433:000433_4 : 11:22:37:403: Tu as pas de se font n'importe . 4
11:23:000434:000434_0 : 11:22:41:551: Chaque outils finalement va vous permettre d'adresser une problématique y a pas un outil qui va être capable de vous donner la cause le pourquoi et le comment donc faut les prendre faut les utiliser à chaque fois dans le bon cas est-ce que je dois m'en 2e. C'est extrêmement important d'avoir une approche systémique donc ce que j'entends . 1
11:23:000435:000435_2 : 11:22:59:675: Est capable de voir en fait ce qui s'est passé si vous faut que je sais seulement sur votre API ça va être impossible parfois de des buggies toute la chaîne donc il faut à chaque fois utiliser le bon outil au bon moment . 2
11:23:000436:000436_3 : 11:23:14:828: Enfin composition de chaque outils en ce moment parle beaucoup de observabilité et finalement l'observer observabilité c c une vision systémique de votre infrastructure . 3
11:23:000437:000437_4 : 11:23:26:962: J'espère vraiment que vous allez utiliser ces outils au niveau de ses méthodes vous avez commencé peut-être oui c'est pas déjà dans votre entreprise mets un point qui va arriver c'est que ce que je vois très souvent . 4
11:24:000438:000438_1 : 11:23:43:117: On crée des dashboard c'est génial . 1
11:24:000439:000439_2 : 11:23:46:167: Mais en fait ils sont jamais regardé . 2
11:24:000440:000440_3 : 11:23:49:441: Ce qui arrive très souvent c'est que quand vous avez un incident ça ce moment-là vous avez sur votre dashboard mais comment faite vous ai jamais pris l'habitude de le regarder vous êtes un peu perdus pour une personne extérieure je pense à ceux qui font par exemple . 3
11:24:000441:000441_4 : 11:24:05:562: Allez sur ce dashboard et regarder ça en fait comme connaissez pas la plate-forme très peu vous êtes complètement perdu . 4
11:24:000442:000442_1 : 11:24:13:694: Super important n'importe quel mettez en place de prendre le temps avec vos équipes de border d'expliquer voilà c'est comme ça qu'il faut lire cette métrique c'est comme ça qu'il faut interprété par exemple . 1
11:24:000443:000443_2 : 11:24:27:831: Dutex Oran pas avoir peur d'être verbeux c'est ok c'est un outil de dataviz mais ça va sur toi aussi vous aider à corréler à comprendre ce qui se passe . 2
11:25:000444:000444_3 : 11:24:37:956: Qu'est-ce qu'il a 7 m et sa source de données c'est ça et que c'était . 3
11:25:000445:000445_4 : 11:24:43:848: Ça rejoint finalement le quand je dis be readable se voit la visibilité entre vous étiez . 4
11:25:000446:000446_0 : 11:24:50:973: avoir le même Dashboard. Avec une vie on produit sera toujours plus intéressant à mon sens qu'une vision juste infrastructure apprécié toute les équipes regarde je suis pas vous avez une interface qui va avoir peut-être des parties différentes . 1
11:25:000447:000447_2 : 11:25:04:108: Mais tout le monde va regarder le même aussi ça c'est très intéressant au moins de capable de dire voilà il y a pas chacun . 2
11:25:000448:000448_3 : 11:25:14:246: Il y a rien qui marche . 3
11:25:000449:000449_4 : 11:25:17:378: Je t'aime . 4
11:26:000450:000450_1 : 11:25:21:873: Application . 1
11:26:000451:000451_4 : 11:25:47:148: Femme contre s en détail ce que je veux . 4
11:26:000452:000452_1 : 11:25:57:004: Un sac par exemple sur les métriques en présence de grâce . 1
11:26:000453:000453_2 : 11:26:03:141: Derrière qui va être utilisé par les carbone carbone agrégation . 2
11:26:000454:000454_3 : 11:26:10:285: St max 1 minute . 3
11:26:000455:000455_4 : 11:26:14:623: En fait c'est très . 4
11:26:000456:000456_1 : 11:26:21:018: Adresser Paris finalement . 1
11:27:000457:000457_2 : 11:26:23:523: Maman finale . 2
11:27:000458:000458_3 : 11:26:28:696: Brick menthe ski autour du conteneur légendaire . 3
11:27:000459:000459_4 : 11:26:36:827: Chapoutier . 4
11:27:000460:000460_4 : 11:27:12:318: Oui Alan fait ça va dépendre surtout du Japon le niveau de maturité de vos équipes . 4
11:27:000461:000461_1 : 11:27:21:442: Pour moi c'est ça . 1
11:27:000462:000462_2 : 11:27:24:584: Faire quasiment tous les maillons de la chaîne d'une application . 2
11:27:000463:000463_3 : 11:27:29:291: C'était très bon sur le monitoring location c'est une bonne chose et après au faire à mesure il faut que je sois capable d'en descendre dans toutes les chaînes . 3
11:27:000464:000464_4 : 11:27:38:419: Cybernet maison son père apporté très difficile aujourd'hui dans cet écosystème j'ai une grosse . 4
11:28:000465:000465_1 : 11:27:45:540: Finalement pour votre requête il y a des y a des briques applicative style . 1
11:28:000466:000466_2 : 11:27:52:689: Ils ont . 2
11:28:000467:000467_3 : 11:27:55:823: J'ai reçu une requête et finalement elle est passé par ce ne l'a elle est passé par cette application exetera nous . 3

11:38:000479:000479_3 : 11:38:06:821: Contributeur sur un projet open source on est dans un contexte de route et il faut bien capable de s'adapter ac environnement la . 3
11:38:000480:000480_4 : 11:38:13:702: Donc ça concerne notamment travail à distance complet mais . 4
11:38:000481:000481_1 : 11:38:19:528: Ça confirme en gros ça concerne tout ce qui est grosse boîte ou boîte de la start-up nation ça concerne tout ce qui groupe tout ce qui association tout ce qui groupe d'activistes ou compact Ibis tout ce qui est communauté travail open source en gros ça s'applique à peu près tout le monde et je vois à ses potes contexte si vous en avez je suis preneur dans lequel le remote . 1
11:39:000482:000482_2 : 11:38:20:528: J'en ai pas le contraire . 2
11:39:000483:000483_3 : 11:38:48:572: Émission française et encore il y a des gens qui travaillent . 3
11:39:000484:000484_4 : 11:38:54:705: Après c'est quand tu quand a des contrats de physique typiquement effectivement contact de clientèle ça se complique en dans une boutique et de travailler en remote . 4
11:39:000485:000485_1 : 11:39:05:849: À partir du moment où tout ce qui est nécessaire c'est derrière un poste de travail et d'avoir un accès réseau Cécile de prénom pour tous . 1
11:39:000486:000486_2 : 11:39:15:358: Alors qui est concerné . 2
11:40:000487:000487_3 : 11:39:19:504: J'ai pensé quand j'ai commencé à rédiger se trouve j'ai pensé à tous ceux qui ont envie d'avoir du remote mais qui ne savent pas comment le mettre en place ou comment l'appliquer ce soit les gens au sein de l'entreprise où ce soit l'entreprise qui va y mettre en place du remote . 3
11:40:000488:000488_4 : 11:39:20:504: Vous qui pensais qu'on ne peut pas travailler à distance le but du jeu de vous démontrer que si c'est vrai . 4
11:40:000489:000489_1 : 11:39:43:117: Qui dirige et en projet une start-up structure est-il considéré que toutes les rock-star pour venir bosser dans votre boîte erreur elles ont déjà une vis quelque part avec des amis elles vont pas déménager pour venir à côté de chez vous . 1
11:40:000490:000490_2 : 11:39:58:249: Laquelle elles peuvent travailler correctement donc il essaye de passer au travail à distance alors effectivement travail à distance a beaucoup d'avantages . 2
11:40:000491:000491_3 : 11:40:08:392: Retour d'expérience de travail à distance c'est plus simple parce que vous pouvez découper plus correctement c plus adapté à vos rythme travail vous pouvez le faire à peu près partout comme vous voulez sur les horaires qui vous conviennent . 3
11:41:000492:000492_0 : 11:40:23:526: Du 18 au bureau normalement ça vous donne une meilleure qualité de vie parce que vous avez moins de déplacement où j'irai mieux ça diminue votre à. De carbone si vous êtes soucieux du fait c'est plutôt cool si vous n'êtes pas intéressé . 4
11:41:000493:000493_1 : 11:40:39:681: Mais c'est pas magique c'est aussi énormément d'inconvénient concrètement c'est pas un truc qui se met en place en claquant des doigts de chez moi et puis appuyez souci ça fait beaucoup de discipline et beaucoup de discipline . 1
11:41:000494:000494_2 : 11:40:54:817: Attention attention à la distraction s'il y a un truc auquel je ne m'attendais absolument pas en commun commençant à travailler à distance j'ai découvert en commençant travail à distance c'est que finalement c'est une expérience sur laquelle on en apprend beaucoup sur soi . 2
11:41:000495:000495_3 : 11:41:08:952: Incapable de se découvrir beaucoup et après à trouver des trucs sont pas forcément très cool et à se découvrir soi-même comme étant a peut-être un peu plus procrastinateur penser . 3
11:41:000496:000496_4 : 11:41:19:100: Faire un peu de travail d'introspection si son choix . 4
11:41:000497:000497_1 : 11:41:22:493: Alors petit tour des mis tes fantasmes autour du thé travail qui sont je voulais ça sur tes phrases que j'ai réellement entendu en parlant de télétravail alors on a déjà dit que toute façon on pouvait bien bossé que si on était tous ensemble au même endroit . 1
11:42:000498:000498_2 : 11:41:38:017: Je vois pas pourquoi . 2
11:42:000499:000499_3 : 11:41:40:540: Surtout quand on est parti dans des open space avec du bruit de l'action il activités autour d'un besoin de se concentrer quand c'est chiant donc je vois pas pourquoi on peut serait mieux on attend tous même endroit c'est pas vrai . 3
11:42:000500:000500_4 : 11:41:53:795: Comment je peux être bien sûr que tu bosses . 4
11:42:000501:000501_1 : 11:41:57:485: Tu peux me faire confiance . 1
11:42:000502:000502_2 : 11:42:01:622: C'est peut-être un des plus gros soucis qu'on a dans nos organisations et dans le souhait pour aujourd'hui c'est son problème de confiance et falation recrute des gens recrute parce que mon . 2
11:42:000503:000503_3 : 11:42:11:768: Ajouter de ce qu'il faut faire confiance à fliquer les gens donc tu peux pas être sûr que je veux c'est être de regarder ce que je te livre . 3
11:42:000504:000504_4 : 11:42:20:702: Besoin de la tête . 4
11:43:000505:000505_1 : 11:42:24:700: Série du profit harcèle là quand j'ai entendu elle m'a fait super mal me dit oui de toute façon tu préfères passé leur temps sur Netflix plutôt que de bosser . 1
11:43:000506:000506_2 : 11:42:37:837: Celle-là elle était aux . 2
11:43:000507:000507_3 : 11:42:41:981: Tu veux passer une pension Netflix et mon problème pas le tien et puis et puis je peux aussi bosser à fond dans une série j'ai connu et je connais encore c'est toujours un des meilleurs intégrateur qui soit extraordinaire . 3
11:43:000508:000508_4 : 11:43:00:117: Prends systématiquement dans le car inférieur gauche de l'écran un film qui tournait en permanence et il m'a te défiles moi qui connaît et ce qu'il fait les meilleures intégration j'ai jamais vu quoi ce type était parti ou brillant . 4
11:43:000509:000509_1 : 11:43:14:263: C'est pas vrai quoi . 1
11:43:000510:000510_2 : 11:43:16:898: On peut faire ce qu'on veut quoi on ne peut pas garantir la cybertek depuis ailleurs que le bureau alors ok dans les années 90 ou 2000 je veux bien le croire quand on a passé tous pour des gros VPN dégueulasse à ça va maintenant on a quand même des techniques qui permettent de garantir la sécurité . 2
11:44:000511:000511_3 : 11:43:37:032: Dire que il faut que les gens sont dans un endroit physique pour garantir la sécurité c'est un problème de sécu quoi on doit pouvoir bosser de n'importe où sans aucun de sécu . 3
11:44:000512:000512_4 : 11:43:45:351: Tu veux du Fou le remote ouais d'accord ok mais alors je vois que tu sois au moins une fois par semaine sur site . 4
11:44:000513:000513_1 : 11:43:54:504: C'est peut-être on peut s'entendre là tu mets juste c'est pas du faudrait vraiment veux mettre les gens travaillent distance complet complet . 1
11:44:000514:000514_2 : 11:44:04:636: Tout le monde a exigé ça si je te l'accorde ça parler on me l'a dit aussi je dis ok bah si tout le monde l'exige c'est qu'a priori un problème c'est que mon reprise est toxique et ces gens se sont pas bien pour travailler chez toi et qui préfère travailler ailleurs dans un environnement kik . 2
11:44:000515:000515_3 : 11:44:20:358: Question de si tout le monde vitae Tribe c'est qu'un souci quelque part en tout cas il va falloir penser un peu la façon de travailler . 3
11:45:000516:000516_4 : 11:44:28:107: Ok ta distance et si si j'ai besoin de toi . 4
11:45:000517:000517_1 : 11:44:34:247: Il a quoi au travail il y a pas de souci je reste joignable c'est pas vrai que je veux parce que je suis à distance . 1
11:45:000518:000518_2 : 11:44:43:381: C'est pas dans notre culture de tout façon web une piqûre ça se travaille ça se change ça c'est donc il y a pas de soucis on peut insérer dans l'ADN d'une boîte ça c'est pas vrai que toute façon tu te fiches et ça n'est pas un autre compte activité donc c'est tout à l'heure effectivement si . 2
11:45:000519:000519_3 : 11:45:02:510: Contacte de clientèle ou ah oui effectivement c'est compliqué si ça ne nécessite aucun accès distant et potentiellement un téléphone on peut le faire vraiment de n'importe quoi . 3
11:45:000520:000520_4 : 11:45:13:658: Boucher nous je voudrais le support est fait par des gens qui sont tous envie de souci ça fonctionne . 4
11:45:000521:000521_1 : 11:45:22:793: Alors comment ça s'organise . 1
11:46:000522:000522_2 : 11:45:30:907: Ça va être de construire une culture et l'idée ça va être de dire on veut trouver une base commune sur laquelle on est tous d'accord pour avancer ça veut dire construire des valeurs et construire un manifeste dans lesquelles tout le monde va se retrouver mais c'est pas un truc qui se trouve magiquement . 2
11:46:000523:000523_3 : 11:45:48:057: Le patron de la boîte aussi haut de la boîte qui dit viens on est des Warriors . 3
11:46:000524:000524_4 : 11:45:55:214: Ajoutons veulent je vous assure sans une boîte où les valeurs c'est ça que je veux rester . 4
11:46:000525:000525_1 : 11:46:02:347: Cherche un travail de valeur c'est qu'on se met tous autour d'une table et on raisonne ensemble et on réfléchit ensemble à ce qu'on veut porter dans un projet alors ouais ça reste un boulot dans le cas de boulot ouais c'est un contexte le boulot c'est normalement pas notre vie en fait je passe au moins 8 heures par jour c'est pas plus donc un moment faut qu'on se retrouve . 1
11:47:000526:000526_2 : 11:46:20:481: Cette boîte parce qu'on a envie de faire quelque chose qu'il faut trouver ses valeurs et ça veut dire qu'il va faire mettre en place des comme un référentiel sur le monde va se retrouver tout le monde est d'accord pour travaille ensemble . 2
11:47:000527:000527_3 : 11:46:31:578: Ça veut dire aussi qu'il va falloir mettre en place du mentorat dire que quelqu'un arrive dans une structure où les gens sont potentiellement tous en remote et il va falloir il va falloir accueillir ces gens il va falloir les intégrer dans le la dynamique d'équipe et ça ça passe très bien par du mentorat le fait de désigner un parent au sein d'une boîte qui va être la personne . 3
11:47:000528:000528_4 : 11:46:49:713: Ça veut dire aussi qu'il va falloir mettre en place du mentorat dire que quelqu'un arrive dans une structure où les gens sont potentiellement tous en remote et il va falloir il va falloir accueillir ces gens il va falloir les intégrer dans le la dynamique d'équipe et ça ça passe très bien par du mentorat le fait de désigner un parent au sein d'une Retourner quand on a une première question qui vous réduire à te dire quelqu'un d'autre mais au moins on est pas beau mais quoi parce que quand vous êtes tout seul et vous êtes en plus à distance c'est pas forcément évident . 4
11:47:000529:000529_1 : 11:47:00:953: Il faut sauver un peu aux différentes culture exetera . 1
11:47:000530:000530_2 : 11:47:06:103: Solution quand ton accueil des nouveaux qui moi me semble pertinent c'est travail sur les mini projet typiquement dans une boîte vous avez toujours des projets qui sont des espèces de side project ils sont pas des projets qu'on offre client mais qui sont des trucs sur des choses comme ça c'est une bonne façon il y a toujours des . 2
11:47:000531:000531_3 : 11:47:23:244: Pas correctement avec pâte de . 3
11:48:000532:000532_4 : 11:47:29:372: Donc c'est bien mettre les gens sur ses projets là parce que d'un seul coup il y a pas d'exigences de rentabilité on est pas sur un temps donné une figure à livrer faut se dépêcher exterra on a un temps où commence à travailler on va sur un mini projet et on voit et surtout ça va permettre de s'ouvrir aux autres comme ça il y a pas de bug . 4
11:48:000533:000533_1 : 11:47:48:511: Je comprends pas cette figure elle fait quoi parce que là je comprends pas ce qui se passe . 1
11:48:000534:000534_2 : 11:47:53:656: S m ont engendré transmettre les compétences et on gère ça comme un projet normal de la boîte ça veut dire que il y a de la restitution ça veut dire que il y a un travail de suivi il y a un travail de chef de projet dessus mais voilà il y a moins d'exigences que une grosse feature à développer . 2
11:48:000535:000535_3 : 11:48:11:787: Il va falloir pour vous qui commencé à bosser en télétravail que vous vous établissez une journée type à quoi ça ressemble . 3
11:48:000536:000536_4 : 11:48:19:989: D'avoir une routine . 4
11:49:000537:000537_1 : 11:48:23:137: Ça peut paraître un peu rébarbatif comme ça mais n'empêche que si vous choisissez de démarrer votre journée un matin à 7h à matin à 10h un matin à 14h est-ce que vous saisissez votre journal moment vous allez venir sur la durée parce que vous . 1
11:49:000538:000538_2 : 11:48:42:268: Donc il faut vous vous imposer quand même un rythme travail qui sont un rythme régulier et son mari mais arrête dans lequel vous êtes bien si vous décidez de démarrer à 11h le matin et finir à 19h le soir il y a aucun souci vous avez le droit de faire ça c'est pas grave quoi il faut que ce soit régulier . 2
11:49:000539:000539_3 : 11:48:57:405: Journée ma copine elle bosse en remote régulièrement et Kalys qui lui arrive régulièrement de faire pour ne pas se taper notamment transport en commun bondé pour pouvoir aller au bureau que sera-ce que le matin elle bosse de la partage qu'elle peut faire facilement à distance de trier les mails envoyer des réponses des appels d'offres exetera . 3
11:49:000540:000540_4 : 11:49:21:553: Plan de travail qu'elle fait matin c'est du travail à distance . 4

11:50:000546:000546_3 : 11:50:24:734: Suffisamment au présent et . 3
11:50:000547:000547_4 : 11:50:30:874: Excuse-moi . 4

11:51:000552:000552_1 : 11:51:07:759: Donc occupez-vous des autres soyez accueillant ne vous entraîner pas dans mon environnement soyez à l'aise dans ce que vous faites ne restez pas dans votre coin parce que si vous restez dans votre fois vous allez vous couper du reste de l'équipe et c'est d'autant plus facile que vous êtes déjà physiquement à distance . 1
11:51:000553:000553_2 : 11:51:25:903: Bouchra mais vraiment physiquement et a pas comprendre pourquoi vous êtes très mais comme ça . 2
11:52:000554:000554_3 : 11:51:31:553: Ensuite un pic une paire de communication . 3
11:52:000555:000555_4 : 11:51:34:874: Comment communiquer correctement avec une équipe qui tape distance alors dans une équipe qui est entièrement distribuer donc je parle vraiment de deux personnes nées dans un même bureau il y a pas de personnes ensemble voilà tout le monde et chacun chez soi ou un truc comme ça . 4
11:52:000556:000556_1 : 11:51:49:015: Plusieurs canaux disponible premier canal to SketchUp messagerie instantanée ou pas c'est parce que vous voulez je vais je vais pas vous donner Dutti c'est pas celui-là c'est vous qui trouverait le confort et le Bounty qui vous correspond . 1
11:52:000557:000557_2 : 11:52:04:142: Donkey déposer dans une équipe entièrement distribuer . 2
11:52:000558:000558_3 : 11:52:09:214: Vous avez accès à des de chats vous avez acheté à lire ses Dixon pépé du lac whatever je m'en fous mais vous avez toujours la messagerie instantanée du canal sur le toujours quelqu'un allez trouver quelqu'un discuter avec . 3
11:53:000559:000559_0 : 11:52:23:357: Fonctionne pas c'est un moment il y a un doute si un moment il y a un truc soit vous passez en son du meuble jusqu'à ce que vous voulez mais vous parler parce que d'un seul coup la communication écrite il y a tout un partout tympan d'émotions qui ne passe pas que vous allez pouvoir retrouver avec le son donc ça va permettre de levée des
11:53:000560:000560_1 : 11:52:41:501: Encore une fois du scalp du web RTC ça fonctionne si on additionne répondu mais ça fonctionne donc n'hésitez pas à trouver des solutions ou pour discuter . 1
11:53:000561:000561_2 : 11:52:54:611: 50 80 /:/ indication très important et qui vont permettre encore une fois de l'ambiguïté . 2
11:53:000562:000562_3 : 11:53:02:756: Ok pas de souci ça va bien se passer . 3
11:53:000563:000563_4 : 11:53:05:621: Il y a tout ce qui communications qui n'est pas en temps réel . 4

11:54:000565:000565_2 : 11:53:29:910: Donc ça c'est quand on est entièrement distribuer dans une équipe qui est partiellement distribuer il y a des gens qui sont en tous ensemble dans un bureau et d'autres qui sont à distance et bah c'est pareil pas tout à fait mais c'est partir du moment où vous pouvez considérer que l'intégralité . 2

12:32:000759:000759_1 : 12:32:07:324: Confiance au fait que si on recrute des gens qui regardent souci elle fait ça se passera très bien parce que c'est vraiment inclus maintenant dans l'ADN de effectivement il y a 2 ans . 1
12:32:000760:000760_2 : 12:32:18:470: Créez qu'on était pas tout à fait prêt à cueillir des nouveaux entrants tout de suite en remote . 2
12:33:000761:000761_3 : 12:32:24:599: Aucun souci . 3
12:33:000762:000762_4 : 12:32:26:722: L'intégralité de travailler vraiment déporté . 4
12:33:000763:000763_1 : 12:32:30:855: Oui . 1
12:34:000764:000764_3 : 12:32:43:173: Ouais clairement une boîte sur cahier des soucis de communication déjà dès le départ le remote en fait c'est terrible c'est que le remote en soit fait une chambre de résonance quoi et s'il y a des problèmes structurels dans une dans une boîte d Compass en remote c'est vachement amplifier parce que d'un seul coup le manque de présence physique commence à compenser un peu . 3
12:35:000766:000766_4 : 12:33:26:284: Ça c'est plus là donc ça explose ça fait sauter tous les filtres et clairement une boîte qui est pas prête à passer en remote ben c'est clairement une boîte qui de départ a des soucis il fonctionne l est-ce que je disais aussi je te donne du monde . 4
12:36:000767:000767_1 : 12:33:43:418: Effectivement il y a un souci quoi c'est tout le monde veut bosser loin de la voix c'est qu'il y a un truc qui est pas bon dans la boîte donc donc effectivement avant de commencer à passer au Rio ou si vous voyez que vous faites passer au remote comment ça va générer des problèmes engendrés par monts des problèmes énorme c'est que Prométhée déjà là avant il faut s'occupe . 1
12:36:000768:000768_4 : 12:35:43:782: Ensuite tu peux effectivement arrivé sur le plan financier CD économie économie pour lui pas les transports est-ce qu'il va financer de ta part de travailleurs Immo sera toujours inférieur à ce qu'il aurait on est en employant physiquement sur place donc . 4
12:36:000769:000769_1 : 12:36:00:926: Et après je dirais que un bon argument se mettre en confiance aussi . 1
12:36:000770:000770_2 : 12:36:07:062: C'est la confiance et c'est le fait que c'est pas parce que ta distance que tu vas trahir sa confiance en moi il va vite se rendre compte que ce que tu lui dis c'est dans les temps c'est correct que ça se passe bien que le reste de l'équipe et qui a pas de souci et après as un truc qu'on a tendance à oublier mes . 2
12:36:000771:000771_3 : 12:36:24:870: Mais de quoi est la période d'essai elle va dans les deux sens la période d'essai elle permet un employeur avec qui ça se passe pas bien pour un nouveau salarié de rompre . 3
12:37:000772:000772_4 : 12:36:36:464: C'est prendre le risque que ça se passe avec ça ça permet aussi un salarié dire ça se passe pas bien moi je vais pas rester dans ces conditions-là quoi il faut pas hésiter arguer de ça aussi on . 4
12:37:000773:000773_1 : 12:36:37:464: Pro 4 mois devant nous pour voir comment ça se passait pour itérer régler les soucis et si on voit qu'on arrive pas à bosser ensemble . 1
12:37:000774:000774_2 : 12:36:56:151: J'ai pas grave peut-être que du coup tu diras bon ben écoute je tiens un trait sur le télétravail ou peut-être que tu iras bah écoute non j'ai pas fait pour essayer de se forcer à rentrer dans une autre . 2
12:37:000775:000775_3 : 12:37:10:279: Juste parce que mon gros on craint pour son boulot c'est pas une bonne idée . 3
12:37:000776:000776_4 : 12:37:15:821: Dans le cas malheureux . 4
12:37:000777:000777_1 : 12:37:18:961: Prix pour insister sur le fait que la période d'essai renouvelable que par salarié un truc oublie trop souvent mais une boîte à voir autour . 1
12:37:000778:000778_2 : 12:37:28:303: Seule personne qui peut renouveler un coup interdit . 2
12:38:000779:000779_3 : 12:37:33:431: Journée de trois mois boîte qui dit on vous renouvelle votre pc se passer dans l'illégalité total . 3
12:38:000780:000780_4 : 12:37:40:439: Je sais pas et voilà ouais . 4
12:38:000781:000781_1 : 12:37:45:478: Ouais c'est ça j'étais en free-lance n'a pas mal de temps . 1

12:38:000783:000783_3 : 12:38:01:472: Est-ce que c'est la rencontre indépendant je dirais que . 3
12:39:000784:000784_0 : 12:38:09:507: Mais oui mais ça dépend ce que tu entends par bosser plus en gros moi ce que je faisais quand j'étais en Inde FC que je bossais j'étais en train de prod du lundi au jeudi et le vendredi c'était ma journée galère ça veut dire que je passais de dans tout ce qui était gestion de la compta tout ce qui s'était gestion des merde c'était pas urgent d'eau. Que gentiment si . 4
12:39:000785:000785_1 : 12:38:10:507: Un gros bug ou quoi tu interromps ce que tu fais puis quoi je le truc quoi si c'est un truc qui peut attendre reporter ça ou vendredi d'après et puis je me disais pas de ça vendredi donc tu fais ta prospection . 1

12:39:000789:000789_1 : 12:39:25:426: Sac à main ça me va très bien ton projet pas venir je suis salarié aussi . 1
12:40:000790:000790_2 : 12:39:32:552: Si possible de garder du temps faut pas se brader . 2
12:40:000791:000791_3 : 12:39:37:689: Va des compétences elle va le Cher et c'est ça qui est valorisé aussi quoi . 3

14:53:000003:000003_2 : 14:52:22:682: Bonjour tout le monde . 2
14:53:000004:000004_3 : 14:52:36:819: Cette difficile d'avoir le . 3
14:54:000005:000005_4 : 14:52:40:470: Il efficace . 4
14:54:000006:000006_2 : 14:53:03:839: Est-ce que ça marche . 2
14:54:000007:000007_4 : 14:53:49:202: Bonjour tout le monde merci d'être venu . 4
14:54:000008:000008_2 : 14:54:05:360: Alors . 2
14:54:000009:000009_0 : 14:54:11:483: Présente je suis Xavier Ordoquy
14:55:000011:000011_4 : 14:54:15:647: Je suis freelance depuis depuis quelques années je fais beaucoup de développement un python Django je travaille beaucoup avec des API ce qui m'a amené à devenir corps développeur sur Django rest framework . 4
14:55:000012:000012_1 : 14:54:31:804: Vous me retrouverez régulièrement sur hyères c voyeurs sous le nom de l'hymne Aubiac à la structure que j'ai créé quand je me suis mis à mon . 1
14:55:000013:000013_2 : 14:54:42:140: Donc ben je suis parler de rêve donc ça sujet que que j'aime beaucoup ce qu'il m'a poussé à faire ce talk que cette année ça fait un peu suite un truc que j'ai fait l'année dernière sur différentes façons de traiter les API et j'étais pas complètement satisfait de la façon . 2
14:55:000014:000014_3 : 14:55:06:802: Approche par rapport à REST l'impression surtout de le rater quelques trucs donc j'ai beaucoup j'ai essayé de chercher des informations sur ce que c'était reste essayer de voir un petit peu un petit peu plus concrètement en fait ce que c'est parce que on a pas mal de . 3
14:56:000015:000015_4 : 14:55:23:966: Marché et puis des fois on se rend compte que d'un pratique bah ça marche pas et voilà donc du coup j'ai essayé de creuser un petit peu de sujet pour essayer de comprendre ce qu'il se faisait bien / mal . 4
14:56:000016:000016_1 : 14:55:36:112: Donc un petit rappel rapide reste donc ces représentations des transferts donc c'est un transfert d'une robe d'un état d'une représentation d'un état . 1
14:56:000017:000017_2 : 14:55:53:244: Un concept ce qui a été mise en avant paroles feeling la personne que vous voyez là oùRoy Fielding donc riding a travaillé pendant un paquet d'années je crois soutenir les protocoles de ce qu'on connait aujourd'hui au niveau du web . 2
14:56:000018:000018_3 : 14:56:13:387: Et à force d'aller en conférence de défendez de défendre expliquer ses principes des protocole là il y a fini par identifier un certain nombre de principes donc il a mis de côté qu'il à pied ça donc reste donc ils sont . 3
14:56:000019:000019_4 : 14:56:34:535: La raison pour laquelle . 4
14:57:000020:000020_1 : 14:56:38:679: Le succès aujourd'hui . 1
14:57:000021:000021_2 : 14:56:41:814: Alors pourquoi . 2
14:57:000022:000022_3 : 14:56:44:953: Quoi ça reste toujours aussi abstrait aujourd'hui alors ça c'est un radis en fait c'est un style d'architecture donc ça s'oppose clairement a des protocoles comme ça . 3
14:57:000023:000023_4 : 14:56:59:105: Nom des protocoles . 4
14:57:000024:000024_1 : 14:57:02:242: c'est un joli mot un peu près un ça a été un peu près pour moi et du coup bah le style d'architecture en fait ce qui se passe c'est que ça c'est non pas une façon concrète de faire des choses c'est simplement . 1
14:57:000025:000025_2 : 14:57:17:387: application de contraintes . 2
14:57:000026:000026_3 : 14:57:21:496: la on a un example Un exemple donc . 3
14:57:000027:000027_4 : 14:57:24:633: Le d'étude en a deux choses constater en architecture on a deux styles d'architecture : on a une cathédrale gothique et une et une cathédrale romane . 4
14:58:000028:000028_1 : 14:57:33:757: On arrive à identifier la quelle est la quelle par contre pour dire précisément qu'est-ce qui qualifie une cathédrale de Romane et qu'est-ce qui qualifie une romane c'est un petit peu compliqué . 1
14:58:000029:000029_3 : 14:57:50:043: Appelle aussi d'architecture c'est quelque chose très très abstrait difficile de ramener manière concrète . 3
14:58:000030:000030_1 : 14:58:05:318: pour rest, . 1
14:58:000031:000031_2 : 14:58:07:448: ce Qui a été apportée comme contraintes qui est identifié . 2
14:58:000032:000032_3 : 14:58:13:594: L'enfer vert qu'on a deux machine qui discutent ensemble mais pas sur les même pas forcément c'est la même machine . 3
14:58:000033:000033_4 : 14:58:21:722: Ça des communications inter process . 4
14:59:000034:000034_1 : 14:58:25:227: Pour la une contrainte stateless c'est-à-dire que la communication se font sans conservation des d'etat par exemple quand on a du WebSocket . 1
14:59:000035:000035_2 : 14:58:37:364: Et puis il m'a tout ce qui a été envoyé avant est conservé par serveur ou par le client et terre pour les communications ultérieure . 2
14:59:000036:000036_3 : 14:58:45:510: c'est cachable Veut dire que donc on peut avoir des couches intermédiaires qui qui cache les données qui les refaire sans forcément aller voir les autres les autres on a une interface uniforme c'est un système qui est en couche donc tout à fait mettre plusieurs plusieurs strates unes sur les autres donc dans le . 3
14:59:000037:000037_4 : 14:59:05:653: il y a des proxy il y a des . 4
14:59:000038:000038_1 : 14:59:08:803: Il y a du cache . 1
14:59:000039:000039_2 : 14:59:13:942: Quel cadeau me demande qu'est-ce que le serveur pour envoyer pour aider à compléter des informations sur ce que sur des données . 2
14:59:000040:000040_3 : 14:59:21:838: Je t'attends un peu vite . 3
15:00:000041:000041_4 : 14:59:24:047: Ok . 4
15:00:000042:000042_1 : 14:59:32:172: Parmi les contraintes donc l'interface uniforme en fait on a plusieurs c'est un petit peu plus détaillée . 1
15:00:000043:000043_2 : 14:59:43:334: 4 grandes grandes lignes: tout d'abord c'est qu'on peut identifier les ressources auquel on discute de manière unique ressources on a la manipulation de ressources à travers des représentations . 2
15:00:000044:000044_3 : 15:00:00:492: Envoyer des informations au client et puis enfin récupéré cette représentation . 3
15:00:000045:000045_4 : 15:00:06:400: les Message s'ecrivent tout seul c'était qu'on a pas besoin d'avoir des contextes préalable pour à comprendre le message message tout seul suffit et enfin on utilise de l'hypermedia pour viendra . 4
15:00:000046:000046_1 : 15:00:25:556: Ça c'étaitla theorie générale pour être un petit peu plus pratique je suis partie d'une API donc il faut simplement pour prendre rendez-vous chez le docteur . 1
15:01:000047:000047_2 : 15:00:37:145: example qui a été pris par Martine Frommer . 2
15:01:000048:000048_3 : 15:00:44:258: RPC des premières RPC dernière version d'essai vers système un peu plus reste . 3
15:01:000049:000049_4 : 15:00:53:278: le RPC donc c'est remote procédure call donc simplement on va appeler des fonctions à distance et on va récupérer un résultat donc globalement c'est ce que font sauter graphql de manière de manière sensiblement plus compliqué . 4
15:01:000050:000050_1 : 15:01:09:437: Donc pour prendre rendez-vous donc on va envoyer un service prise de rendez-vous . 1
15:02:000051:000051_2 : 15:01:16:621: La première chose à faire déjà c'est de savoir essayer d'identifier quand est-ce qu'on peut prendre rendez-vous donc on va leur demander lui demander de récupérer l'ensemble des créneaux disponibles donc ça c'esy laction fetchopenslots . 2
15:02:000052:000052_3 : 15:01:30:739: On va demander pour la date donc par exemple pour le 4 janvier de midi avec le docteur auquel. 3
15:02:000053:000053_4 : 15:01:38:467: Regarder dans sa base ce qu'il peut correspondre à nous renvoyer pas ici de données donc en disant d'aller le docteur auquel un rendez-vous est disponible de 14h à 14h50 . 4
15:02:000054:000054_1 : 15:01:53:611: une fois qu'on a ces informations la que choisir le moment où on va faire notre rendez-vous donc là on va prendre . 1
15:02:000055:000055_2 : 15:02:09:748: Recherche un poste sur techno . 2
15:02:000056:000056_3 : 15:02:15:885: on va demander de réserver un créneau avec le docteur Jones et donc là de 14h à 14h50 pour le patient donc le serveur nous répondre en disant ok j'ai bien pris en compte le docteur . 3
15:02:000057:000057_4 : 15:02:33:012: À 14h50 avec Monsieur . 4
15:03:000058:000058_1 : 15:02:36:453: Le RPC, expose une interface au fourniture des services comme son pays graphql au fournil toute une expression l'interface pour dire das qu'on peut ce qu'on peut faire son copain . 1
15:03:000059:000059_2 : 15:02:49:611: C'est basé sur du schéma du json . 2
15:03:000060:000060_3 : 15:02:52:741: Prudente on viendra peut-être un peu dessus tout à l'heure c'est qu'ils HTTP en tant que couche de transport et non pas de transfert pour un protocole applicatifs de plus haut niveau donc on utilise vraiment HTTP pour . 3
15:03:000061:000061_4 : 15:03:10:868: Transmission to come on pourrait avoir une connexion TCP ip tout simplement . 4
15:03:000062:000062_1 : 15:03:15:651: Donc là dessus par rapport aux contraintes de reste donc on est en mode client Server donc ça parce qu'on a . 1
15:03:000063:000063_2 : 15:03:21:798: Distance et on conserve pas d'état entre les deux on est un autre compte . 2
15:04:000064:000064_0 : 15:03:30:945: On a absolument rien de rien d'uniforme et nation peux pas insérer de couche intermédiaire dans système là puisque c'est une connexion point à point. . 3
15:04:000065:000065_4 : 15:03:42:956: la première étape pour un transformer cette interface afin d'utiliser des uri donc d'identifier nos ressources et pour voir à qui on va dire avec qui on va discuter manière distinct . 4
15:04:000066:000066_1 : 15:03:58:430: La l'idée générale c'est de . 1
15:04:000067:000067_2 : 15:04:02:586: La complexité . 2
15:04:000068:000068_3 : 15:04:05:717: dviser pour gérer La complexité . 3
15:06:000069:000069_4 : 15:04:08:852: Si on a un patient directement s'adresser au docteur Jones . 4
15:06:000070:000070_1 : 15:04:16:008: Créneau disponible pour la date du 4 4 janvier 2010 . 1
15:06:000071:000071_2 : 15:04:21:907: Serveur ne répond comme à peu près comme tout à l'heure sauf qui va rajouter des informations permettant d'identifier . 2
15:06:000072:000072_3 : 15:04:31:215: Au premier pour premier créneau et en 72 par exemple pour 2e . 3
15:06:000073:000073_4 : 15:04:36:497: Un prof sectionnéc Sur le créneau 43 oneau va réserver va faire une réservation pour le patience me . 4
15:06:000074:000074_0 : 15:04:49:507: Le serveur me répondre ok pout le créneau 43
15:06:000075:000075_4 : 15:05:04:028: Donc ici on est quasiment mes messages tout à l'heure sous qu'on a quand même rajouté une identification des ressources à savoir à qui on parle et on va pouvoir identifier de manière totalement extérieur . 4
15:06:000076:000076_1 : 15:05:20:163: Les échanges entre client et serveur a qui on s'adresse. 1
15:06:000077:000077_2 : 15:05:24:267: un petit souci avec ce mode de fonctionnement . 2
15:06:000078:000078_3 : 15:05:33:388: Bateau qui va passer ça va passer en disant ok ok de serveur n'a toujours répondre ok ok et puis vint le jour où ça va pas marcher il va dire aussi ok mais en faite le problème c'est que l'erreur . 3
15:06:000079:000079_4 : 15:05:45:516: Requête HTTP regarder à l'intérieur quel genre quel genre d'erreur . 4
15:06:000080:000080_1 : 15:05:51:872: c'est absolument pas dépendant de développer et c'est absolument pas . 1
15:06:000081:000081_2 : 15:05:59:995: Du coup pour avancer on va utiliser un petit peu plus ce protocole HTTP . 2
15:06:000082:000082_3 : 15:06:07:641: Au niveau de ressources . 3
15:07:000083:000083_4 : 15:06:10:774: Pour prendre notre rendez-vous donc on va toujours aller interroger un déjà donc là on va plus faire un post on va aller interroger des disponibilités du docteur Jones sur la date . 4
15:07:000084:000084_1 : 15:06:22:893: Envoyer données donc ça . 1
15:07:000085:000085_2 : 15:06:29:477: Avec le serveur puisque tout est indiqué au niveau de l'URL . 2
15:07:000086:000086_3 : 15:06:36:015: Taux du verbe HTTP c'était hier que tu as pas besoin de rentrer à l'intérieur du protocole de regarder est-ce que le client a envoyé pour comprendre ce qu'il veut faire . 3
15:07:000087:000087_4 : 15:06:46:378: après la réservation et donc là en fait . 4
15:07:000088:000088_1 : 15:06:55:121: Là par contre que renvoie . 1
15:08:000089:000089_2 : 15:06:59:270: Du coup le renvoie 1 201 ok pour nous dire ok ça a été créé . 2
15:08:000090:000090_3 : 15:07:09:302:Pour nous dire pour me confirmer que ça a été créé et du coup là encore de manière totalement extérieur toutes les briques intermédiaires du système donc c'est proxy les caches et compagnie pouvoir passer ce cas de la et savoir qui c'est passer le temps . 3
15:08:000091:000091_4 : 15:07:26:046: Dans le cas d'erreur par exemple si j'essaie de reréserver . 4
15:08:000092:000092_0 : 15:07:31:210: le serveur me dire comment on fait tu peux pas il y a déjà un slot de pris. conflit 409
15:08:000094:000094_3 : 15:07:59:043: On peut aller interroger les créneaux enseigne envoie la liste des créneaux on peut aller à créer des créneaux donc on fait un poste sur le sur la liste des créneaux donc ça nous fait une création si on fait un guide sur un slot sur un créneau particulier dont par exemple 123 ça nous afficher les informations de Secret . 3
15:08:000095:000095_4 : 15:07:60:043: Un patch on peut faire une mise à jour partiel et Inde il est où va le supprimer . 4
15:08:000096:000096_1 : 15:08:25:165: Oui bah on est bien en fait sauf qu'en fait, en vrai . 1
15:09:000097:000097_2 : 15:08:31:311: REST c'est absolument pas à propos de à propos de sa . 2
15:09:000098:000098_3 : 15:08:35:996: Ça c'est une simplification . 3
15:09:000099:000099_0 : 15:08:39:143: On a beaucoup plus de lattitude au niveau de REST
15:11:000100:000100_4 : 15:08:40:143: il faudrait . 4
15:11:000101:000101_1 : 15:08:44:395: Niveau REST sur les niveaux d'ailleurs de http pardon au niveau des requêtes on a des familles de requête donc on a des familles qui sont dites donc . 1
15:11:000102:000102_2 : 15:08:56:535: Pas avoir d'action côté serveur . 2
15:11:000103:000103_3 : 15:09:00:665: Un va il va y avoir absolument aucune aucune action côté serveur ils ont cédé au c'est au niveau supplémentaire sans savoir ce que l'intérieur du intérieur de la requête Le détail voir le détail de la Roquette on sait que c'est la . 3
15:11:000104:000104_4 : 15:09:16:778: Du côté des requêtes qui vont faire . 4
15:11:000105:000105_1 : 15:10:57:600: D'autres ben on va se passer on a un identifiant ressources on peut manipuler les ressources à travers les représentations . 1
15:12:000106:000106_2 : 15:11:09:657: les messgaes écrit tout seul parce que ma avec toutes les informations qu'on envoie dans l'en-tête et non pas dans le corps du message on a pas besoin d'avoir d'informations supplémentaires et systèmes et on peut te faire mettre des couches intermédiaires cache / proxy. 2
15:12:000107:000107_3 : 15:11:24:792: Il reste quand même une contrainte à ce niveau-là qui remplit hypermédia . 3
15:12:000108:000108_4 : 15:11:32:724: Notre réparer tout de suite donc l'hypermédia . 4
15:12:000109:000109_2 : 15:11:36:837: Rajouter des hyperliens donc . 2
15:12:000110:000110_3 : 15:11:42:132: Habitude de voir sur le site web l'intérêt de rajouter des liens au niveau des réponses des API ça va permettre d'éviter au client d'avoir à connaître les adresses des ressources auquelles ils doivent discuter . 3
15:12:000111:000111_4 : 15:11:59:411: si on Reprend . 4
15:12:000112:000112_1 : 15:12:02:542: Les disponibilités du docteur donc ici on va rajouter des URL dans les réponses et dire bah voilà par exemple . 1
15:12:000113:000113_2 : 15:12:11:685: Disponible à l'url à /43 . 2
15:13:000114:000114_3 : 15:12:17:807: Du coup ça permet au niveau du client quand quand on va causer le client qui valait interrogé s'est tapé . 3
15:13:000115:000115_4 : 15:12:26:947: Supprimer ses informations d'accès de l'information qui sont souvent les mettre directement dans le client . 4
15:13:000116:000116_0 : 15:12:27:947: Les urls venaient à changer il faut réécrire tous les clients
15:14:000117:000117_2 : 15:12:41:409: Inversement tout à fait changer par exemple et du coup les identifiants s'associe aux clients donc si on avait des entier par exemple si on met des U10 . 2
15:14:000118:000118_3 : 15:12:55:237: Si je veux aller à interagir avec la réservation le créneau 43 Abassi veux aller à interagir avec qui va suivre le lien qui lui a été fourni non plus se baser sur le l'identifiant pour retrouver sa . 3
15:14:000119:000119_4 : 15:13:09:208: Heure maintenant il reste encore un souci c'est quand on regarde cette url là c'est un peu compliqué c'est un peu compliqué . 4
15:14:000120:000120_4 : 15:13:45:137: Voir à côté ça en dur côté client on peut utiliser donc . 4
15:14:000121:000121_1 : 15:13:52:276: Du coup on peut utiliser des templated URI qui correspondent au RFC6570. 1
15:15:000122:000122_0 : 15:14:03:447: Découper
15:15:000123:000123_3 : 15:14:09:580: Voir dire voleur de temps on va injecter des variables donc par exemple ici on va voir même pour le nom du docteur vous avoir la date and status paramètres de la Roquette . 3
15:15:000124:000124_4 : 15:14:21:169: Et du coup on peut tout à fait faire une dent on peut se faire une page de garde ici non qu'on veut dire par exemple là on a une feuille de temps et ton ses feuilles de toi sont disponibles 1 2 suivante donc charge au client donc le client a pas besoin de connaître cette url a priori il est capable de la construire je lui donne . 4
15:15:000125:000125_1 : 15:14:42:851: Du coup au niveau des URL il y a souvent pas mal de discussions pour savoir comment les construire . 1
15:15:000126:000126_2 : 15:14:53:016: Ma la question ci-dessus c'est un savoir laquelle des deux URL et la plus HTTP exetera mais . 2
15:15:000127:000127_3 : 15:15:02:157: Tout dans l'eure lui arrive directement mon ch docteur H docteur Jones . 3
15:16:000128:000128_4 : 15:15:10:283: Directement dans le chemin du haut ou alors simplement d'aller interroger la liste des créneaux et de fil prépare docteur par,statut/ par date . 4
15:16:000129:000129_1 : 15:15:19:818: Alors ouvrez . 1
15:16:000130:000130_2 : 15:15:22:967: L'autre des URL . 2
15:16:000131:000131_3 : 15:15:26:122: Les deux leçons la seule différence c'est que celle où on utilise ton chemin est caché automatiquement par les sustemes l'intermédiaire est-ce que quand on filtre c'est pas systématique ça dépend de la configuration du cache . 3
15:16:000132:000132_4 : 15:15:43:260: Par contre elle permet d'avoir une décomposition aider filtrage ou des enfants de filtrage beaucoup plus souple par exemple si on veut savoir pour tous les docteurs qui est-ce qui est disponible à telle date suffit d'enlever le filtre docteur alors qu'il faut prévoir a priori . 4
15:16:000133:000133_1 : 15:16:02:038: Maintenant donc toujours toujours dans l'eau de suite pour essayer de rendre le client le plus indépendant du serveur quand même un problème ici c'est quand on reçoit cette url là on sait que on a des variables en année par contre on sait absolument pas quel format . 1
15:16:000134:000134_2 : 15:16:22:173: Informations et quelle format sont attendus est-ce que name est-ce que c'est un a dit hier que c'est un gars qui est-ce que c'est une chaîne de caractère est-ce que c'est autre chose le format date . 2
15:16:000135:000135_3 : 15:16:33:318: comment on format ton status . 3
15:17:000136:000136_4 : 15:16:36:078: Plante à préciser . 4
15:17:000137:000137_1 : 15:16:38:821: Du coup . 1
15:17:000138:000138_2 : 15:16:40:939: En plus loin et on va parler commencer à parler d'un effectivement de hypermédia et les hyper control . 2
15:17:000139:000139_3 : 15:16:47:101: C'est un dernier emploi par rapport au mien donc les hyper contrôle en fait c'est simple si simplement des formulaires par exemple . 3
15:17:000140:000140_4 : 15:16:55:549: ca clest un hyper contrôle bien connu . 4
15:17:000141:000141_1 : 15:16:59:598: Affiche prends l'exemple avec un restant de Tahiti avec sirène 1 hyper contrôle ça va être ça donc si on fait notre récupération reprend notre notre entrée . 1
15:17:000142:000142_2 : 15:17:13:763: Niveau des actions tout ce qu'on peut faire à partir de ce point d'entrée . 2
15:18:000143:000143_4 : 15:17:35:033: On donne la méthode pour dire que bah on va faire une requête HTTP GET . 4
15:18:000144:000144_1 : 15:17:40:418: On donne la référence vers laquelle va le gars de va être fait . 1
15:18:000145:000145_2 : 15:17:48:578: Je précise . 2 _ Précisément tous les champs . 2
15:18:000146:000146_0 : 15:17:51:742: Donc les paramètres de l'URL ." 3
15:18:000147:000147_4 : 15:17:56:891: Docteur qui va du texte la date qui va être une date nos statuts qui va du texte avec par défaut la valeur "open". 4
15:19:000148:000148_1 : 15:18:06:054: Et du coup avec tout ça le client il peut tout à fait construire . 1
15:19:000149:000149_2 : 15:18:11:183: Il y a absolument pas besoin d'avoir au moment de son collage des informations quelconque sur qui doit faire avec ça en fait ce serveur lui envoie toutes les informations pour construire la requête . 2
15:19:000150:000150_3 : 15:18:26:183: Je construis ma réponse du serveur va être donc un ensemble prénom donc ça paraît ça va être un petit peu plus compliqué que la dernière fois donc on a donc "entities" il va être l'ensemble des entités disponible . 3
15:19:000151:000151_4 : 15:18:43:291: Donc on a une liste de 2 ans fait . 4
15:19:000152:000152_1 : 15:18:49:168: En fait on a une liste de deux éléments donc ils sont de classe créneau et dans les propriétés sont le début et la fin il docteur associé non c'est exactement si je reviens en arrière c'est une forme un peu plus compliqué de cet affichage . 1
15:19:000153:000153_3 : 15:19:16:522: Une fois donc là le . 3
15:20:000154:000154_4 : 15:19:20:650: Et on a également dedans associés n'ont qu'à chaque à chaque créneau un lien qui va permettre d'aller naviguer vers ce créneau-là donc là on a un seul lien qui va nous dire vers qui va nous envoyer directement donc si l'utilisateur par exemple . 4
15:20:000155:000155_1 : 15:19:37:819: Sur lui associer . 1
15:20:000156:000156_2 : 15:19:40:666: Avoir un résultat . 2
15:20:000157:000157_3 : 15:19:43:813: Donc là par exemple afficher le créneau 45 sur ce créneau-là donc on était une classe . 3
15:20:000158:000158_4 : 15:19:52:975: Propriété qu'on avait tout à l'heure et dedans on va rajouter des actions qui vont dire là encore au client ce qui peut faire la fois d'après . 4
15:20:000159:000159_1 : 15:19:53:975: Par exemple ça et de réserver le créneau . 1
15:20:000160:000160_2 : 15:20:06:967: Pour réserver le créneau donc on a toujours un titre à destination des humains on a une méthode pour dire ben voilà faut aussi au lieu de faire un GET faire un POST on a la référence vers laquelle on va envoyer ça le type . 2
15:20:000161:000161_3 : 15:20:23:130: Envoyez donc ça a pas réponse un formulaire HTML classique justeun eé-mail ou trois choses et . 3
15:21:000162:000162_4 : 15:20:32:283: Donc en fait ouvrez c'est exactement ce que faire un formulaire . 4
15:21:000163:000163_1 : 15:20:38:427: Première classique on a la méthode . 1
15:21:000164:000164_2 : 15:20:42:575: Un qui l'action et à ma liste des champs ulterieurs . 2
15:21:000165:000165_3 : 15:20:48:459: Donc là on envoie une requête il a donc le serveur ne répond . 3
15:21:000166:000166_4 : 15:20:56:883: Réponds que . 4
15:21:000167:000167_1 : 15:20:58:981: Passion été fait donc 226 la réservation est disponible donc à l'emplacement . 1
15:21:000168:000168_2 : 15:21:07:129: Expression . 2
15:21:000169:000169_3 : 15:21:10:256: Et donc du coup on a la description de réservation derrière . 3
15:22:000170:000170_4 : 15:21:14:811: Donc pour la réservation donc on a mis dépression donc on a de la place on a des liens pour dire bah voilà par exemple la personne qui a réservé ça c'est le patient . 4
15:22:000171:000171_1 : 15:21:32:940: Je veux aller voir le détail des informations Vias passion mettre un lien qui va terminer dessus . 1
15:22:000172:000172_2 : 15:21:39:714: tu as des entités qui sont associés . 2
15:22:000173:000173_4 : 15:21:42:871: L'occurrence était le créneau qui a été réservé initialement . 4
15:23:000174:000174_1 : 15:21:47:779: Look avec les liens et propriétés et à toute une liste d'actions donc ici par exemple on a deux actions qui vont être de d'annuler le créneau donc ici on a fait un delete . 1
15:23:000175:000175_2 : 15:22:01:935: Petit train destination à faire un deal sur l'URL URL . 2
15:23:000176:000176_3 : 15:22:11:088: au format avec tel client et ainsi de suite donc là du coup . 3
15:23:000177:000177_4 : 15:22:18:216: Le serveur envoie toutes les informations au client pour lui permettent de construire naviguez de construire à toutes les étapes intermédiaires de manière totalement indépendante la façon classique c de coder tout ça à la main ici avec les hyper contrôle le serveur qui donne les informations clients et client qui se qui construit un tout tout contexte . 4
15:23:000178:000178_2 : 15:22:47:367: Donc du coup elle le fait que le convertir et beaucoup d'informations client et qu'on les ai mis pour les ai mis de côté serveur ça fait que le client est beaucoup plus souple pour pour évoluer sur des données . 2
15:24:000179:000179_3 : 15:23:02:491: Ça c'est . 3
15:24:000180:000180_4 : 15:23:05:634: Pression c'était un projet pour commencer à faire des factures . 4
15:24:000181:000181_1 : 15:23:10:497: On a une facture avec la possibilité de la mettre à jour et de la supprimer on est incertaine intérieur sûr qu'on peut également mettre à jour est supprimé donc concrètement par rapport à ce qu'on a vu tout à l'heure donc les actions . 1
15:24:000182:000182_2 : 15:23:27:656: Le titre d'un correspondant nom du bouton et la méthode et toutes les informations va arriver après donc quand on clique sur le bouton au niveau du client . 2
15:24:000183:000183_3 : 15:23:40:797: Fichier avec l'affaire talon de champs à remplir nom qui correspond très exactement à ce que le serveur va envoyer donc est-ce que le serveur a envoyé donc ce qu'on avait parlé tout à l'heure tous les champs qui si on a des informations additionnelles . 3
15:24:000184:000184_4 : 15:23:58:922: Celui qui a fait la facture donc il . 4
15:24:000185:000185_1 : 15:24:04:060: Et on a l'URL du client qui est pareil . 1
15:24:000186:000186_2 : 15:24:07:920: Du coup . 2
15:24:000187:000187_3 : 15:24:17:069: Du coup on arrive sur une API a vraiment fassions une architecture qui est vraiment reste . 3
15:25:000188:000188_4 : 15:24:22:800: Donc sur laquelle en fait le client . 4
15:25:000189:000189_1 : 15:24:27:925: Et quand même n'as pas besoin d'avoir beaucoup de connaissances sur ce que ce que le serveur attendre lui en fait c'est serveur qui va renvoyer toutes les informations . 1
15:25:000190:000190_3 : 15:24:42:545: Au niveau des liens des contrôles donc il y a Mike Amundsen qui a fait un tableau assez intéressant sur les différents types de liens et contrôle . 3
15:25:000191:000191_4 : 15:24:56:097: What is a cassé donc au niveau des liens donc identifie de famille principal il y a deux liens qui se ressemble beaucoup mais qui sont fondamentalement différent donc ils sont en lien embed embarqué qui vont correspondre par exemple sur les acheter un mail à une image . 4
15:25:000192:000192_1 : 15:25:15:271: Signification c de signaler au client de que ces informations la vont être assez importante et ont de fortes chances d'être utile dans le contexte . 1
15:26:000193:000193_2 : 15:25:27:342: Un texte qui doit utiliser on a d'autres liens qui sont bons qui vont permettre la navigation . 2
15:26:000194:000194_4 : 15:25:38:475: pour avoir les prochaines Étape dont on Aura peut-être besoin . 4
15:26:000195:000195_1 : 15:25:43:004: Ça va envoyer vers un autre contexte . 1
15:26:000196:000196_2 : 15:25:47:031: On a les lignes tan NYX template m donc ça c'est parce qu'on avait vu tout à l'heure au niveau de haut niveau de la recherche par exemple de Creno ça va permettre d'aller voir un bail filtrer sur Delphine trait sur un . 2
15:26:000197:000197_3 : 15:26:04:864: Ensuite on a des liens qui sont non-idempotents donc ça c'est les formulaires des postes de formulaire a classic et Desbiens idem potency correspondra Audi TT . 3
15:27:000198:000198_4 : 15:26:20:016: Côté contrôle . 4
15:27:000199:000199_1 : 15:26:22:915: Contrôle là ça va permettre de savoir ce qu'on fait avec les ressources donc on a en lecture . 1
15:27:000200:000200_2 : 15:26:30:077: Au niveau des . 2
15:27:000201:000201_3 : 15:26:33:208: Donc au niveau des contrôles donc on a plusieurs types de d'information qui peuvent être intéressantes à avoir et à noter donc pas être le contrôle au niveau de la lecture pour les requêtes en lecture mon savoir . 3
15:27:000202:000202_4 : 15:26:54:328: Requête un de savoir ce que le serveur peux nous envoyer comme informations donc là par exemple on voit que sur le lien à New suis dans le serveur va nous envoyer des applications RSS . 4
15:27:000203:000203_1 : 15:27:08:976: Donner . 1
15:28:000204:000204_2 : 15:27:11:020: Mon appareil côté à côtés mise à jour donc ça ça ça on connaît bien dans les formulaires . 2
15:28:000205:000205_3 : 15:27:20:646: Une porte . 3
15:28:000206:000206_1 : 15:27:25:804: On a un au niveau des contrôles la Façon de d'interagir avec le serveur non qu'est-ce que c'est du poste du Gal du _ coup on a également le type de relation . 1
15:28:000207:000207_2 : 15:27:42:119: Pour un programme nommé donc ça on arrive plus sur le web sémantique si je suis seul un coup est-ce que je peux m'attendre donc ça par exemple ça va être . 2
15:28:000208:000208_3 : 15:27:54:266: Appeler pendant une famille des frères et soeur de ce genre de relation . 3
15:28:000209:000209_1 : 15:28:00:504: pour exploiter tout c'est tout c'est variétés on a different ContentType donc j'essaie c'est ici je passerai pas de temps en détail sachant que certains sont spécialisés dans certaines parties . 1
15:28:000210:000210_2 : 15:28:17:789: N'utilise absolument pas d'autre d'autre possibilité d'un . 2
15:28:000211:000211_3 : 15:28:22:565: Sur les liens . 3
15:29:000212:000212_4 : 15:28:25:287: Au niveau des requêtes . 4
15:29:000213:000213_1 : 15:28:32:433: Tu peux en retour aux sources affaires donc sur la sur une séquence quand on a une API REST ce qu'on va faire c'est qu'on va à manipuler une ressource . 1
15:29:000214:000214_2 : 15:28:44:038: par exemple les réservations . 2
15:29:000215:000215_3 : 15:28:48:186: Vallée modifier les mettre à jour exetera et pas par exemple association va voir des utilisateurs . 3
15:29:000216:000216_4 : 15:28:56:124: Souvent c'est ce qui se passe avec liens simple je sais que dans une réservation va voir des liens vers le docteur vers l'utilisateur vers le client . 4
15:29:000217:000217_1 : 15:29:05:656: Sauf que c'est absolument pas quelque chose d'obligatoire on peut peut-être se faire autrement . 1
15:30:000218:000218_2 : 15:29:12:496: Ton fournir avec notre source de base donc avec notre . 2
15:30:000219:000219_3 : 15:29:17:641: L'ensemble des informations par exemple fournir dans toutes les informations de la réservation on peut aussi fournir le nom du docteur et à toutes informations sur le docteur le nom du client . 3
15:30:000220:000220_4 : 15:29:29:788: Nature restez pas aucune . 4
15:30:000221:000221_1 : 15:29:35:528: Aucune alternative aucune contrainte aucune direction sur quel choix est meilleur entre a simplement avoir des ressources et puis aller interroger plusieurs plusieurs différentes où avoir plusieurs ressources à l'intérieur d'une seule . 1
15:30:000222:000222_2 : 15:29:49:905: Par exemple ici sur la donc si je reviens sur les réservations on a ici donc au niveau des entités on ajoute des entités complètement qui sont les . 2
15:31:000223:000223_3 : 15:30:02:477: Réservation . 3
15:31:000224:000224_1 : 15:30:07:761: Arrêter là si vous avez des questions . 1
15:31:000225:000225_2 : 15:30:17:155: 15 minutes . 2
15:32:000226:000226_0 : 15:30:21:341: Alors alors la question c'est la question de savoir vos différents standard
15:32:000227:000227_3 : 15:31:14:735: Donc la question à savoir par rapport à ces différents standard quels sont leur maturité quel son visage de la réponse donc j'ai pas ici . 3
15:32:000228:000228_4 : 15:31:24:889: Justement dans cette histoire de différents facteurs hypermédia donc d'un sauvegarder quelle propriété tu as envie de mettre en avance sur cette interface hier que si tu veux avoir des choses un petit peu plus dans le utilisé beaucoup d' hyperlien mais pas forcément de contrôle . 4
15:32:000229:000229_1 : 15:31:49:042: Est-ce que tu as envie en fait faut regarder les différents ContentType et je choisis celui qui va parce qu'il y en a qui vont privilégiées des options au détriment d'autres et vice-versa même si tu veux . 1
15:33:000230:000230_0 : 15:32:01:177: Bon faut faire un choix est la première question à poser en fait c'est qu'est-ce que tu veux mettre en avant dans ton API d'abord quel est ton contexte quel est le problème que tu veux résoudre et
15:33:000231:000231_3 : 15:32:17:331: Qui correspondent à ton problème . 3
15:33:000232:000232_1 : 15:32:29:425: Il faut faire un choix . 1
15:33:000233:000233_2 : 15:32:37:492: Alors je suis à Django alors mon 30 2009 je sais même pas si flash qui était déjà connu à l'époque moi ça répond à tous besoin donc du coup j'ai pas . 2
15:36:000234:000234_3 : 15:32:53:670: Je suis pas le temps mon/ arriere train /restaurant pas extensible il y a des choses à faire comme ça comme ça marche comme ça ça marche bien voilà . 3
15:37:000235:000235_4 : 15:33:04:822: Oui . 4
15:37:000236:000236_1 : 15:33:15:933: Alors la question au niveau de Django rest framework est-ce qu'on a une intégration avancer des différents ContentType aller faire à la réponse est aujourd'hui non j'ai besoin encore d'avancer sur le sujet avant de commencer à travailler là-dessus la complexité et tant que . 1
15:37:000237:000237_2 : 15:33:45:107: Lien entre les ressources sont très difficile à modéliser . 2
15:38:000238:000238_3 : 15:33:49:401: Venir à beaucoup de choses différentes et que du coup bah si c'est pas une réponse évidente et ça j'ai besoin encore de réfléchir sur sujet avant de savoir si c'est ne serait-ce que possible . 3
15:38:000239:000239_2 : 15:36:13:237: Libertin . 2
15:39:000240:000240_1 : 15:36:49:094: Bien ça aussi . 1
15:39:000241:000241_2 : 15:37:11:271: Alors la différence c'est que ça se passait pour caméra live . 2
15:39:000242:000242_3 : 15:37:34:130: Ça c'est pour le froid micro en fait au total . 3
15:39:000243:000243_4 : 15:37:38:054: 1 2 . 4

15:39:000247:000247_4 : 15:39:06:184: Oui voilà c'est qui ça se . 4
15:39:000248:000248_1 : 15:39:11:271: Superbe . 1
15:40:000249:000249_2 : 15:39:13:943: Oui . 2
15:40:000250:000250_3 : 15:39:18:741: C'est ça comme ça on a le temps de s'installer . 3
15:40:000251:000251_4 : 15:39:23:810: Série que je vois que il me présenter l'interface du coup . 4
15:40:000252:000252_1 : 15:39:43:364: Jules . 1
15:40:000253:000253_2 : 15:39:47:530: Pays-d'oc . 2

15:42:000256:000256_1 : 15:40:42:592: Par contre nous ça qu'on a pas trop d'interface . 1
15:44:000257:000257_2 : 15:40:51:755: Pas trop de capture à ce niveau-là vrai . 2
15:44:000258:000258_3 : 15:40:56:893: Chant des flamants . 3
15:44:000259:000259_4 : 15:41:00:618: Tu n'avais hier . 4
15:45:000260:000260_1 : 15:41:21:786: Quand tu sais pas mettre en plein écran . 1
15:45:000261:000261_2 : 15:42:03:933: Non je . 2
15:45:000262:000262_3 : 15:44:33:310: Non il est pas encore arrivé . 3

05_Retour d'expérience sur le déploiement de ReadTheDocs en interne Benjamin Divet, Olivier Munier




15:45:000264:000264_1 : 15:44:55:275: Est-ce que nous on a un train . 1
15:45:000265:000265_2 : 15:44:59:163: Ça marche ouais y a pas beaucoup de monde du coup mais . 2
15:46:000266:000266_4 : 15:45:05:334: Alors bonjour tout le monde et merci d'être venu alors . 4
15:46:000267:000267_1 : 15:45:06:334: Lors de cette prochaine petite demi-heure du coup d'un retour d'expérience sur l'installation d'un serveur readthedocs ce en interne . 1
15:46:000268:000268_2 : 15:45:23:963: Donc d'abord pour nous présenter moi et Oli non moi c'est Benjamin disait mon collègue Olivier meunier nous sommes du groupe it link France . 2
15:46:000269:000269_3 : 15:45:36:128: Enseignement connu . 3
15:46:000270:000270_4 : 15:45:39:266: Kiss x sis du coup c'était le nom on avait lors des deux précédentes pycon voilà donc is it link c'est une ESN spécialisé dans l'informatique et qui a notamment ball Python présent tu nous en partie . 4
15:46:000271:000271_1 : 15:45:59:072: Alors pour faire une petite rétrospective . 1
15:46:000272:000272_2 : 15:46:07:213: On avait en faite entrer pour mettre en place readthedocs donc les besoins c'était de centraliser des dômes des documentations de divers projets . 2
15:46:000273:000273_3 : 15:46:19:361: Domaine centre . 3
15:46:000274:000274_4 : 15:46:23:509: Histoire d'avoir vraiment nos process simplifiée à ce niveau-là . 4
15:46:000275:000275_1 : 15:46:30:662: D'une même documentation . 1
15:47:000276:000276_2 : 15:46:33:859: Et aussi répondre à une . 2
15:47:000277:000277_3 : 15:46:39:818: Gestion des points d'accès . 3
15:47:000278:000278_4 : 15:46:40:818: Documentation . 4
15:47:000279:000279_1 : 15:46:46:152: Nous cela quoi on est confronté déjà sur une problématique par rapport à nos à nos projets . 1
15:47:000280:000280_2 : 15:46:55:291: On avait aussi une demande de la part de nos clients donc certains . 2
15:47:000281:000281_3 : 15:47:02:456: Qualité . 3
15:48:000282:000282_4 : 15:47:05:617: Comment on a une confidentialité vraiment importante à respecter et du coup c'était de valider voilà les droits d'accès vraiment pour euh du coup les contraintes qui nous est imposé donc c'était une documentation au format Sphinx doc donc historiquement it link . 4
15:48:000283:000283_1 : 15:47:06:617: Sous format la et beaucoup de nos clients aussi . 1
15:48:000284:000284_0 : 15:47:38:821: Une documentation qu'on puisse héberger sur gitlab gitlab qui a
15:48:000285:000285_3 : 15:47:48:978: Versionning donc j habite . 3
15:48:000286:000286_4 : 15:47:52:117: Donc des solutions qu'on avait envisagé donc tout d'abord on avait pensé à faire le développement à terme d'un serveur dédié donc une solution qu'on n'a pas retenu parce que trop chronophage et aussi parce qu'il existe plein de solutions déjà donc plutôt que d'en inventer la route partir sur quelque chose de l'existant on avait aussi envisager l'utilisation d'un serveur . 4
15:49:000287:000287_1 : 15:48:20:254: Hôtel 5 serveur néanmoins sans rester trop restreint . 1
15:49:000288:000288_2 : 15:48:21:254: Voilà vraiment que diable en fait tellement . 2
15:49:000289:000289_3 : 15:48:31:665: Tu es vraiment trop restreint . 3
15:49:000290:000290_4 : 15:48:35:835: Une solution aussi donc on va commencer voilà parler de readthedocs ce métaux la sur le service en ligne . 4
15:49:000291:000291_0 : 15:48:45:996: Bac qui ne répondez pas voilà la problématique justement de confidentialité de certains de nos clients et du coup l'autre solution et c'est celle qu'on a retenue CE2. Interne d'un serveur Xbox donc à la fois pour répondre à nos process et aussi as eu des clients avec des contraintes de droit plus plus ferme . 1
15:49:000292:000292_2 : 15:49:12:137: Alors ici ce que vous voyez ces l'infrastructure qu'on a au sein de l'équipe python a été link . 2
15:50:000293:000293_3 : 15:49:22:096: Qu'est-ce qu'on voit alors très simplement je vais pas m'étendre sur Despi et Jenkins . 3
15:50:000294:000294_4 : 15:49:30:278: Tu peux te promo mais du coup on a en fait bah en 2016-2017 présenter ses deux . 4
15:50:000295:000295_1 : 15:49:38:832: Tracer 2 solution . 1
15:50:000296:000296_2 : 15:49:41:966: Donc le despy en 2016 trouver la vidéo a été si Maicon 2016 et puis pour Jenkins c'est pareil du coup pouvez retrouver facilement la vidéo . 2
15:50:000297:000297_3 : 15:49:42:966: Du coup ce qu'il y a à retenir de s'être infrastructure donc on a depuis PC on va alimenter la doc donc on va passer pour sa part à part le versionning de guide . 3
15:50:000298:000298_4 : 15:50:15:316: On met à jour la doc ça va être couché sur le serveur du coup readthedocs et met systématiquement du coup la la nouvelle version de la documentation en ligne pour ça on a un service de web Oups qui récupère du coup la dernière version qui met à jour et qui génère derrière cette doc . 4
15:51:000299:000299_1 : 15:50:37:209: Voilà . 1
15:51:000300:000300_2 : 15:50:40:378: Tous nos paquets sur le serveur Despi donc des paquets plutôt que de . 2
15:51:000301:000301_3 : 15:50:48:535: Idée d'avoir un serveur où on met Despi de sucer qu'on puisse avoir nos paquets . 3
15:52:000302:000302_4 : 15:50:55:706: Ben comment . 4
15:52:000303:000303_1 : 15:50:58:476: Et du coup on a vraiment la maîtrise de de nos paquets si demain on doit aller . 1
15:52:000304:000304_2 : 15:50:59:476: Appeler bah Jenkins du coup pour tout ce qui est génération de tests unitaires unit test voix l'attestation intégration avec robot framework la couverture de TELUS et le dit de code avec . 2
15:52:000305:000305_3 : 15:51:19:806: Alors pour présenter brièvement et de dox donc il s'agit d'un serveur de documentation Open Source donc écris en python et utilisant le framework python Django le format d'entrée C5 doc et ce que va générer readthedocs ce CD format tel que le html . 3
15:53:000306:000306_4 : 15:51:46:959: Élie pub donc intéressant puisque derrière on va pouvoir les exploiter et facilement les traiter les envoyer les imprimer s'il faut . 4
15:53:000307:000307_1 : 15:51:58:134: Ça permet . 1
15:53:000308:000308_2 : 15:52:00:287: Chez facilement transmissible on a cet intérêt qui sait qu'on a gardé cette solution c'est la gestion des versions qui permet vraiment voilà de versionner chaque publié donc intéressant si on veut retrouver des docks des précédentes fois et on a un moteur de recherche . 2
15:53:000309:000309_3 : 15:52:25:457: Cible du coup c'est elasticSearch donc on va voir un petit peu plus tard du coup ce qu'il en est au niveau de son installation . 3
15:54:000310:000310_6 : 15:52:35:294: Les prérequis pour Xbox donc nous en lien avec notre Afrah structure C Linux on a choisi de mettre en place linux pour ça la version 3.6 de python avec Virtual ans du coup et on l'a déployer du coup avec Django la version 2.5 . 4
15:54:000311:000311_1 : 15:53:01:200: Est-ce qu'il faut aussi et ça c'est par rapport à élastique elasticSearch OpenJDK donc parce que elasticSearch fonctionne avec du Java . 1
15:54:000312:000312_2 : 15:53:13:334: Voilà les prérequis autres sont kit et aussi Mercurial donc deux outils de gestion de versionning nous c'est plutôt dit qu'on utilise . 2
15:54:000313:000313_3 : 15:53:25:781: En Italie et bah voilà ce qu'il vous faut derrière c'est un accès Internet ou alors un serveur de paquet comme on le voyait du coup avec avec Despi . 3
15:55:000314:000314_4 : 15:53:37:940: Du coup j'ai passé une micro à Olivier c'est lui qui va faire la suite d'un présentation . 4
15:55:000315:000315_1 : 15:53:45:483: J'ai un peu l'impression d'être Robocop donc moi je file à vous voyez rien c'est normal le but que je vais vous présenter c'est un petit peu une structure le document présent on va le donner aux organisateurs de la paille clown pour kilomètres disponibilité souci donc si vous voulez développer appuyez-vous sur ce document il a plus office du coup en l'occurrence n'a plus tôt . 1
15:55:000316:000316_2 : 15:54:26:644: Maman une présentation je vous rappelle que on est sur un retour d'expérience et non pas faim sur vraiment un sujet technique de fond c'est pour ça appuyez-vous sur ce document il sera présenté normalement en tout cas nous on mettra disponibilité des organisateurs de la paye donc il devrait pouvoir se retrouver avec la vidéo sur le site l'installation du serveur du coup si elle . 2
15:56:000317:000317_3 : 15:54:52:785: Pas mal de place et qu'elle un petit peu technique donc . 3
15:56:000318:000318_4 : 15:54:57:312: La présentement on va faire ça dans un environnement virtuel ski comme souvent le cas vous qui l'utilisez du Piton régulièrement les vents vous connaissez donc on va installer python raidissent comme base de données et ensuite la à la fin de du code on active l' environnement virtuel ensuite . 4
15:56:000319:000319_1 : 15:55:19:363: Sûrement virtuel évidemment on récupère le code de readthedocs donc là en fait avec un en fait à partir du Ripault guide lui dis pas au guide pour avoir la dernière version stable où faire aussi avec les versions de . 1
15:57:000320:000320_2 : 15:55:20:363: Et on installe avec PIP install donc du coup pour déployer tous les bacs à Mende . 2
15:57:000321:000321_0 : 15:55:41:078: On utilise la django vers le milieu il y a marqué déploiement de la BDD utiliser manage.py why 2e qui est un outil de gestion de configuration de Django crée la base de données est un con super-utilisateur qui nous servira au moment où réside Ops réinstaller pour se connecter dessus . 3
15:57:000322:000322_4 : 15:56:03:616: Donc à ce stade-là readthedocs est installé et fonctionnel mais il a pas encore de moteur de recherche et là donc tout à la fin la dernière ligne de code c on lance avec le serveur Web interne de Django qui n'est pas évidemment recommandée en production mais au moins on peut déjà testé que ça fonctionne . 4
15:57:000323:000323_1 : 15:56:25:357: Ensuite comme je disais précédemment il y a pas de moteur de recherche c'est comme très pratique quand on a beaucoup de documentation de pouvoir chercher donc là il faut installer dastic search alors elasticSearch c'est une sacrée gymnastique parce que il existe un plugin pars version de doc et si vous trouvez aussi vous avez pas le bon du coup ça fonctionnera pas et ce sera . 1
15:57:000324:000324_2 : 15:56:50:512: Et moi très difficile à débloquer donc le tableau qu'elle a juste à droite il est pas là pour faire joli c'est pour montrer vraiment les versions . 2
15:57:000325:000325_3 : 15:57:00:348: Plugin à utiliser pour Tail version du document du logiciel . 3
15:57:000326:000326_4 : 15:57:07:416: Rhizoloc on récupère mon là c'est un point Dead donc on l'a récupéré via Debian et puis on le déploie donc tout simplement . 4
15:58:000327:000327_1 : 15:57:16:574: Pour pour qui sera pour l'installer . 1
15:58:000328:000328_2 : 15:57:21:510: Une fois qu'il a installé on dit à Django ça y est . 2
15:58:000329:000329_3 : 15:57:27:058: Évidemment donc via système 5 ou système D ça dépend sur la distribution Linux que vous utilisez quel système de service est présent . 3
15:58:000330:000330_4 : 15:57:37:646: Et on va dire . 4
15:58:000331:000331_1 : 15:57:39:996: On va pouvoir tester avec la comment cuire le tout à la fin qui fonctionne toujours intéressant de savoir que le service conviennent installer danser et fonctionnel et ensuite on va dire à Django voilà tu as tu vas chercher sur le port 92001 service elasticSearch présent c'est qui qui va pouvoir du coup indexer la documentation présente . 1
15:59:000332:000332_2 : 15:58:04:149: Ce qu'on fait afin d'avoir une documentation enfin une recherche toujours en accord avec la documentation on a mis dans une crotte une tâche cron . 2
15:59:000333:000333_0 : 15:58:15:300: L'indexation qui est lancé toutes les 5 minutes donc il existe d'autres manières effectivement de lancer l'indexation de la documentation par rapport à ça peut être ou exetera nous le choix et effets de lancer dans une tâche cron comme ça on est sûr que modulo 5 minutes la doc toutes les dernière version d'Adobe sont toujours indexé
15:59:000334:000334_4 : 15:58:38:434: Certes mais elle fonctionne . 4
15:59:000335:000335_1 : 15:58:40:899: Ensuite étant donné qu'on veut avoir un readthedocs en interne . 1
16:00:000336:000336_2 : 15:58:46:375: Créer un fichier de configuration local juste pour indiquer en fait sur quel nom de domaine ou quelle adresse IP locale dans l'infrastructure est présente le . 2
16:00:000337:000337_3 : 15:59:03:533: Appeler site quoi donc là voilà c'est expliqué dans ce document . 3
16:00:000338:000338_4 : 15:59:09:927: Suite on paramètres les URL en fait on utilise gunicorn comme serveur WSGI bon un serveur qui sert à faire une passerelle python vert le ou d'autres serveurs Web où lui-même directement en web c'est pour faire pour servir les fichiers statiques . 4
16:00:000339:000339_1 : 15:59:29:798: Le beaucoup ici sauf que c'est aussi possible de le faire avec un jean IKKS là on a pris gunicorn c'est aussi un choix . 1
16:00:000340:000340_2 : 15:59:38:383: Et évidemment du coup avoir un gitlab accessible pour du coup pouvoir aller se s'interfacer dessus et puis pour l'authentification par gitlab on a fait une on a enregistré la clé de une paire SSH pour que du coup il y a pas un enregistrement manuel à faire ce qui pourrait être un petit peu lourd évidemment . 2
16:00:000341:000341_3 : 16:00:00:999: Donc le on démarre gunicorn pour pouvoir avoir évidemment le serveur fonctionnelle . 3
16:00:000342:000342_4 : 16:00:09:842: Et puis donc du Clos du coup il a lancé sur le port 8 1000 par exemple un ça peut être sur d'autres de porc et puis bon on la technique pour l'arrêter c ont-ils directement le Puy Heidi avec la commande qui permet de retrouver ça c'est très . 4
16:01:000343:000343_0 : 16:00:26:249: Maintenant ça y est on a un readthedocs fonctionnel d'un point
16:01:000344:000344_2 : 16:00:35:399: Bon va bien que sur le port 8 1000 sur la sur l' IP locale on a le serveur qui fonctionne qui répond tout bien . 2
16:01:000345:000345_4 : 16:00:42:608: Avec le super-utilisateur qu'on avait créé au début dans dans Django on se connecte à eau dashboard de . 4
16:01:000346:000346_1 : 16:00:50:668: HDD projet donc là on peut voir . 1
16:01:000347:000347_2 : 16:00:55:282: Un peu mal de choses . 2
16:01:000348:000348_3 : 16:00:58:748: Qu'on peut importer des projets c'est pas très lisible excusez-moi mais comme je vous ai dit précédemment . 3
16:01:000349:000349_4 : 16:01:07:012: On apporte un projet . 4
16:02:000350:000350_1 : 16:01:09:695: Ton . 1
16:02:000351:000351_2 : 16:01:11:569: Donc le projet peut être évidemment sur Internet peu de sur Github bitbucket exetera nous en l'occurrence c'est en local ça nous intéresse donc on utilise le importer manuellement . 2
16:02:000352:000352_3 : 16:01:26:972: Fini l'adresse IP toujours sur lequel est hébergé le bain des guides donc Raymond donne un nom donc jusqu'à la c'est tout simple . 3
16:02:000353:000353_4 : 16:01:37:465: Suite on a les prunes un anglais qui apparaît avec du coup les projets disponible donc là on voit les projets boule en l'occurrence y en a qu'un mais bon après ils sont accessibles à partir d'ici . 4
16:02:000354:000354_1 : 16:01:52:204: Et chaque projet à son dashboard du coup son interface de gestion qui lui est propre et donc laquelle on peut définir tout un tas de . 1
16:03:000355:000355_2 : 16:01:53:204: Bon tout ce qui est inhérent vraiment au projet de documentation les droits d'accès exetera son réseau doc propose quand même un nombre assez intéressant de fonctionnalité sur la gestion de la documentation . 2
16:03:000356:000356_3 : 16:02:15:579: Ensuite . 3
16:03:000357:000357_4 : 16:02:18:714: Mettre avant c'est évidemment pas ces quelques exemples un petit peu de de de ce qui peut se passer dessus . 4
16:03:000358:000358_2 : 16:02:25:989: Donc les versions qu'on Tout à l'heure du PDF to ePub tout un tas vie du HTML si les trois principaux Milia des plugins pour faire dodo truc c'est assez simple on peut définir tout ça ici dans l'interface de gestion et là du coup on rentre dans une partie qui est un petit peu plus général c'est . 2
16:03:000359:000359_3 : 16:02:55:499: La documentation à chaque fois qu'on fait un point poux sur sur guide c'est-à-dire pour avoir une donc toujours à jour c'était ce qu'on expliqué au début avec l'infrastructure à chaque fois que la doigt qui est modifiée du coup on fait forcément un push sur dit et là il y a un hook qui va lancer readthedocs et c'est là dans ton paramètres cela pour justement que la doc . 3
16:03:000360:000360_4 : 16:03:15:655: Ce soit jour directement et accessible . 4
16:03:000361:000361_1 : 16:03:19:783: La le la procédure et expliquer ici . 1
16:04:000362:000362_2 : 16:03:24:697: Donc . 2
16:04:000363:000363_3 : 16:03:26:839: Bilan de tout ça . 3
16:04:000364:000364_4 : 16:03:29:246: Readthedocs c'est un outil qui fonctionne bien et qui efficace qui peut me comporte beaucoup de paramètres par contre la documentation c'est assez difficile de la trouver sur le web y a assez peu de doc sur son déploiement . 4
16:04:000365:000365_1 : 16:03:44:784: Le . 1
16:04:000366:000366_2 : 16:03:46:918: Rona Lenorman on est un système de gestion de version bon en l'occurrence l'on peut pas tout les avoir pour l'instant on est encore hein c'est quelque chose d'intéressant fait dans la boîte on a que la dernière version qu'on convienne créer un disque . 2
16:05:000367:000367_3 : 16:04:02:036: Il doit y avoir un paramètre activer quelque part . 3
16:05:000368:000368_4 : 16:04:07:503: Certaines pages au moment de la configuration des fois il y a des messages d'erreur et ses messages d'erreur en fait il faut se relooker en admin un simple user il verra un message d'erreur malgré cette que ça fonctionne pareil c'est peut-être aussi au niveau du nez clown qui fait un ONU qui sert les fichiers statiques le message son passant par apprécié quoi qu'il en soit en cela . 4
16:05:000369:000369_1 : 16:04:07:503: Refresh la page et les messages d'erreur disparaissent donc ils peuvent exister alors que le message erreur n'existe pas si problème visuel mais dans le fond ça fonctionne . 1
16:05:000370:000370_3 : 16:04:37:364: Et donc Le l'ensemble est cohérent fonctionnelle Hérin répond à nos attentes . 3
16:06:000371:000371_4 : 16:04:51:655: Voilà on a fini donc si vous avez des questions . 4
16:06:000372:000372_1 : 16:04:59:615: Il reste 4 minutes left . 1
16:07:000373:000373_2 : 16:05:02:706: Donc oui . 2
16:07:000374:000374_2 : 16:05:40:599: La documentation au format 5 donc la question c'était de d'avoir . 2
16:07:000375:000375_3 : 16:05:56:274: La nécessité d'avoir une documentation on parle souvent de la documentation nous sommes développeurs la documentation d'api High qui sont dans les docstring du Piton qui peuvent et effectivement aussi est parti avec readthedocs et on peut faire une documentation d'habillage en l'occurrence nous ce qui nous intéresse la plus tôt c'est la documentation qui va vraiment à . 3
16:07:000376:000376_4 : 16:06:15:405: Derrière le piment session utilisateur donc l'utilisateur les API sais pas vraiment ce qui m'intéresse c'est vraiment le côté fonctionnel donc là on parle en fait d'une documentation qui est dans des fichiers au format string box une syntaxe de Markdown qui permet d'avoir de générer des documents comme on a vu PDF HTML et c'est plus sur cette documentation là qu'on s'intéresse . 4
16:07:000377:000377_1 : 16:06:40:521: Au début on en a parlé un petit peu de la documentation client en fait il y a une documentation donc développeurs qui en règle générale reste dans l'entreprise et une documentation client qui elle va être proposé justement soit livré sous forme de documents soient sous forme d'une URL qui qui point sur notre infra ou alors on a des clients qui vaut carrément déployer . 1
16:07:000378:000378_2 : 16:07:01:701: Infra enfin bref mais si les deux sont possibles avec readthedocs . 2
16:08:000379:000379_3 : 16:07:08:284: Les deux sont fait d'ailleurs avec ce système là mais celle qui nous intéresse le plus dans le cas présent c'est plus les doigts utilisateur parement pour livrer le logiciel avec sa documentation . 3
16:08:000380:000380_4 : 16:07:19:862: Je puisse la . 4
16:08:000381:000381_1 : 16:07:22:815: Oui . 1
16:09:000382:000382_2 : 16:07:26:951: Readthedocs propose à la question c'était sous les clients critique le lundi de la sécurité d'accès à la documentation alors isodoc il propose du coup un système de déjà de login password pour se connecter à une partie de . 2
16:09:000383:000383_3 : 16:07:54:102: Euh non je crois pas que c'est vraiment l'intérêt . 3
16:09:000384:000384_4 : 16:07:58:241: Merci la sécurité des clients ouais donc il faut déjà un système de login password ça permet d'avoir aussi un niveau un certain contrôle d'accès un utilisateur qui va avoir un certain nombre de droits pour accéder à certaines parties de la documentation du coup à certaines documentation en l'occurrence il y a certains clients et les clients supercritique typiquement la défense . 4
16:09:000385:000385_1 : 16:08:26:387: Il faut même pas proposé ils vont pas vouloir du coup que nous le SNIT Link et berge leur documentation et le du coup fasse un service donc on héberge et oui se connecte dessus soumaintrain fera ils peuvent la connecté c'est l'arrivée de voir ça chercher les critiques les clients qui ont des documentations . 1
16:10:000386:000386_2 : 16:08:49:506: Du coup alors créer des log in D password ils peuvent se connecter dessus et derrière nous on peut choisir ou au même que choisir de dire que certains utilisateurs vont avoir accès à certaines parties de la documentation ai pas d'autre c'est assez souple d'une certaine manière pour pouvoir . 2
16:10:000387:000387_3 : 16:09:09:329: Je n'ai pas accès à toutes les informations et donc soit potentiellement perdu dans une boîte qui souhaiterait conséquences c'est qui qui l'intéresse pas dans son corps de métier . 3
16:10:000388:000388_4 : 16:09:20:475: Une équation . 4
16:11:000389:000389_3 : 16:09:34:512: Aucune idée j'espère qu'il y a un effectivement à plugin ldap pour ou Active Directory . 3
16:11:000390:000390_4 : 16:09:43:863: Django et donc du coup on bénéficie d'un certain nombre de plugin alors après ce qu'il a vraiment idée connexion qui sont faites . 4
16:11:000391:000391_3 : 16:10:14:396: Moi on peut lui filer un ePub . 3
16:11:000392:000392_4 : 16:10:21:318: Merci alors on peut lui parler lu parler lu parler lu parler . 4
16:11:000393:000393_2 : 16:10:26:460: Loxen le digital . 2
16:11:000394:000394_2 : 16:10:56:201: Service module . 2
16:11:000395:000395_3 : 16:11:02:885: Alors actuelle à ma connaissance résidence dispose . 3
16:11:000396:000396_4 : 16:11:10:319: D'accord donc ça d'accord donc Circus proposerai un système de gestion des services qui bouge Unicorn . 4
16:11:000397:000397_1 : 16:11:21:908: D'accord . 1
16:11:000398:000398_2 : 16:11:29:635: C'est propre la commande . 2
16:30:000399:000399_3 : 16:11:35:763: Sauce on récupère le pied Heidi puis on fait-il demain météo le Puy . 3
16:30:000400:000400_4 : 16:11:40:917: Ouais avec les bouteilles tu sais très bien chaîne . 4
16:30:000401:000401_1 : 16:11:46:852: Merci beaucoup . 1
16:30:000402:000402_2 : 16:11:49:993: C'est bon . 2


06_Django & GraphQL Mehdi Raddadi


16:36:000404:000404_2 : 16:29:54:198: Alors est-ce que ça marche pas du tout . 2
16:36:000405:000405_3 : 16:30:33:352: Ça a l'air d'être bon . 3
16:36:000406:000406_4 : 16:30:37:126: Ouais mais ça va pas je pense pas que ça gêne de . 4
16:36:000407:000407_1 : 16:30:49:096: Je n'aime plus que ça . 1
16:36:000408:000408_2 : 16:30:51:420: Merci . 2
16:36:000409:000409_1 : 16:32:31:145: Bonjour à tous est-ce que vous m'entendez jusqu'au font pas du tout . 1
16:37:000411:000411_3 : 16:36:14:073: Moi je vais vous parler aujourd'hui de GrahQL avec Django . 3
16:37:000412:000412_4 : 16:36:19:121: Je m'appelle Mehdi Raddadi je suis développeur à polyconseil et je fais principalement du Django du view . 4
16:37:000413:000413_1 : 16:36:28:026: Un peu de Graphql du coup donc pour ceux qui connaissent pas polyconseil c'est une entreprise de conseil d'à-peu-près 150 personnes . 1
16:37:000414:000414_2 : 16:36:36:516: En particulier de l'équipe qui travaille en python et donc parmi les projets que vous connaissez peut-être c'est Autolib' . 2
16:37:000415:000415_3 : 16:36:46:652: Autolib c'est le système de partage de voiture qui était à Paris jusqu'à juillet dernier avait été fait entièrement en python Django pour le pour le système d'information et il comprit les jambes arquées qui était dans les voitures et dans les bornes . 3
16:38:000416:000416_4 : 16:37:05:372: Alors on va commencer par une rapide introduction pourquoi est-ce que j'en suis venu à graphql ensuite je vous présenter graphql en lui-même pour vous expliquer à quoi ça correspond et après on viendra à une à l'implémentation en python avec graphene et ensuite on ira les chercher un peu plus loin pour voir c'est mignon tout ça mais est-ce que concrètement ça marche si . 4
16:38:000417:000417_1 : 16:37:27:565: on cherche À faire plus de choses avec . 1
16:38:000418:000418_2 : 16:37:30:423: Alors pourquoi donc le voilà pas mal évalué évoluer sur sur les dernières années . 2
16:38:000419:000419_3 : 16:37:37:390: On était sur une architecture surtout avec bah on avait un client un serveur 11 et les requêtes dessus et nous répondez donc on pouvait faire le Skype horizontalement exetera . 3
16:39:000420:000420_4 : 16:37:49:221: Aujourd'hui on est plus passés sur différents clients donc à la fois du web à la fois du téléphone à la fois des tablettes mais aussi sur différentes choses au niveau du serveur donc potentiellement même avec des architectures microservices sur des choses qui peuvent être très différentes derrière et qui discutent . 4
16:39:000421:000421_1 : 16:38:07:130: Oui REST ça existe ça marche si vous avez des questions je vous invite à regarder la présentation qui a eu lieu aujourd'hui sur REST . 1
16:39:000422:000422_2 : 16:38:16:248: Mais ça marche pas forcément tout le temps donc je suis pas là pour vous expliquer que graphql est mieux que reste je suis pas là pour faire l'évangéliste je suis là pour vous montrer à quoi ça sert donc REST c'est pas un standard . 2
16:39:000423:000423_3 : 16:38:29:430: Ça ça peut être implémenter de manière assez différente ça peut être ça peut devenir compliqué à certains endroits alors après c'est pas ça veut pas dire que grave qu'elle va répondre à vos questions ça veut juste dire que vous avez des questions à vous poser au moment de l'architecture est-ce que concrètement quelle est la solution vous avez . 3
16:39:000424:000424_4 : 16:38:50:553: Et enfin l'une des problématiques de REST ça va être de vous avez besoin de faire . 4
16:39:000425:000425_1 : 16:39:00:169: Trespa ressources donc si vous avez besoin par exemple d'une ressource en particulier mais vous avez besoin de différentes données de cette ressource vous pouvez être amené à crête différence entre . 1
16:39:000426:000426_2 : 16:39:10:815: Alors qu'est-ce que c'est GraphQL . 2
16:39:000427:000427_3 : 16:39:15:012: Alors graphql c'est un langage de requête donc comme son nom l'indique c'est vraiment pour faire des requêtes ça a pas de présupposition de ce de ce qui se passe derrière c'est vraiment juste ben j'ai besoin d'une donnée j'ai besoin de d'un certain nombre de choses et ça va être la manière dont je vais le récupérer ça a été créé par facebook en 2015 open source et en 2016 . 3
16:40:000429:000429_2 : 16:39:43:317: Alors . 2
16:40:000430:000430_3 : 16:39:47:430: Bien voir que . 3
16:40:000431:000431_4 : 16:39:49:562: Graphql ça va pas être . 4
16:40:000432:000432_1 : 16:39:53:687: Graphql c'est vraiment un langage de requête faut voir ça un peu comme le SQL du web. 1
16:41:000433:000433_2 : 16:40:00:120: Donc là vous avez par exemple une requête . 2
16:41:000434:000434_3 : 16:40:04:338: Et de récupérer des informations donc là ce que 17 rue ket sais que je veux pas par exemple tout mes TODO je veux leur identifiant à quelle date a été créé je veux savoir balle créateur qui c'est je veux pas juste son identifiant et la description du tout donc là vous voyez vraiment le je veux quelque chose du coup je le demande et je l'écris . 3
16:41:000435:000435_0 : 16:40:24:708: En quelle en graphql il y a différentes il y a des objets donc ça dire que graphql c c base et bah comme son nom l'indique sur un graphe donc vous allez pouvoir récupérer différentes choses et bah typiquement vous allez voir que si on prend l'idée du graphe
16:42:000436:000436_1 : 16:40:43:873: Et ensuite on va descendre pour aller chercher, potentiellement les liens entre cet élément et d'autres objets donc là par exemple on commence par les sous-objets ensuite on descend sur par rapport à ce qu'il y a cet objet je veux ça . 1
16:42:000437:000437_0 : 16:40:58:011: Différents ont des c'est là qu'on définit les types donc les types c'est ce qui va construire votre paiement est le schéma c'est ce que vous allez pour c'est ce que vous allez exploser est-ce qu'il va expliquer en fait à l'utilisateur de votre API de quoi qu'est-ce que je peux demander à Athènes. Donc là ça c'est du graphql pure
16:42:000438:000438_4 : 16:41:19:148: Images pour n'importe quel type de backend ça sera la même tête donc là par exemple on peut voir que on a des types . 4
16:42:000439:000439_1 : 16:41:28:249: Existe déjà donc par exemple on va avoir les identifiant les chaînes de caractères exetera on a aussi des types qui peuvent être définis par l'utilisateur comme on peut le voir dans la todo list and is the to do . 1
16:42:000440:000440_2 : 16:41:43:386: On en revient qu'est-ce que je peux lui demander à ce que ça me zappés à quoi elle me sert et qu'est-ce que je peux répéter dessus donc on a comme vous l'avez vu tout à l'heure là il va y avoir en fait plusieurs objets donc le premier ça va être les requêtes donc . 2
16:42:000441:000441_3 : 16:42:02:510: Équivalent de je veux j'ai besoin de cette ressource arrête uniquement de la lecture . 3
16:42:000442:000442_4 : 16:42:08:649: SSD fini comme suit donc là par exemple on dit qu'on veut l'utilisateur avec l'identifiant numéro deux et on a besoin de ces informations . 4
16:43:000443:000443_1 : 16:42:16:787: Et donc . 1
16:43:000444:000444_2 : 16:42:18:850: Information elles vont être tournées sous cette forme et comme vous pouvez le voir et bien sûr sur cette requête . 2
16:43:000445:000445_3 : 16:42:28:461: On a exactement ce qu'on a demandé juste avant je sais pas si vous . 3
16:43:000446:000446_4 : 16:42:36:595: Filateur un email exetera et on reçoit exactement le même bloc de données donc c'est-à-dire que à chaque fois vous allez faire votre 4 votre compte ou autre utilisateur va demander à un certain nombre d'information il n'aura pas plus pas moins . 4
16:44:000447:000447_1 : 16:42:50:575: Donc ça présuppose plusieurs choses c'est que la première il va falloir savoir que par exemple vos développeurs il suffisait conscience que de ses ressources ont comment il va pouvoir aller les récupérer vous donner beaucoup de pouvoir à à votre service client parce que bah concrètement il va pouvoir demander plus de choses il va pouvoir demander demande . 1
16:44:000448:000448_2 : 16:43:12:760: Ça ça va vraiment être le produit est le fruit qui va définir les requêtes qui vont à t'envoyer . 2
16:44:000449:000449_3 : 16:43:19:748: Ensuite on en a un deuxième type donc on appelle les mutations les mutations ça va être pour faire de l'écriture donc ça veut dire que ça peut être pour créer des utilisateurs . 3
16:47:000002:000002_4 : 16:43:29:856: On premises ça va être aussi pour toutes les tâches qui vont devoir et exécuter sur le serveur vous pouvez avec une mutation si elle a été dessiné demandé de lancer un chrono demandé de lancer une certaine page une certaine action ça un peu tout et n'importe quoi c'est à vous de le définir . 4
16:47:000003:000003_1 : 16:43:48:438: Et même principe que pour que pour les requêtes ça vous renvoie exactement ce que vous lui avez demandé donc là par exemple on a dit qu'on créer un utilisateur et que quand ça revenait on voulait récupérer son nom son avis exetera et il vous renvoie exactement la même chose c'est bon j'ai bien créé mon utilisateur il a bien ces informations la . 1
16:47:000004:000004_2 : 16:44:10:108: La troisième chose c'est ce qu'on appelle les la notion de l'abonnement les subscription cette notion là en fait ça va être liée à plutôt à du temps réel en gros si vous dites que vous souhaitez vous abonner par exemple à un flux et derrière à chaque fois que il y a une modification sur sur ce fut ça va être mis à jour donc c'est par exemple ce que fait facebook quand vous . 2
16:47:000005:000005_3 : 16:44:11:108: Pasito mon utilise facebook mais par exemple quand il y a un poste et que quelqu'un mais un lac dessus concrètement c'est ce qui se passe derrière ces il y a . 3
16:47:000006:000006_4 : 16:44:44:458: Il va avoir une requête qui va être envoyée en disant bah le poste le poste x a eu un lac de plus est-ce qui sait que se répercuter en fait surtout les autres surtout les autres utilisateurs qui sont actuellement en train de visualiser ce poste et ça va . 4
16:47:000007:000007_2 : 16:47:02:003: Je veux trouver Quelle sont les les ressources disponibles sur ce serveur . 2
16:48:000008:000008_0 : 16:47:07:578: Qu'est-ce que je peux demander donc ça fait à la fois une office de documentation donc ça vous empêche pas décrire la doc attention c'est juste que si vous arrivez sur l'aine. Vous allez pouvoir savoir qu'est-ce qui est disponible donc est-ce que je peux récupérer les TODO qu'est-ce que je peux récupérer dans est-ce que potentiellement vous les verrez pas s'il y a . 3
16:48:000009:000009_4 : 16:47:25:694: Est-ce que c'est qui t'a dit tabac de zapper graphql elle en a une première qui est complètement public et qui vous permet de récupérer scrap et ce qui se passe dans les répose hitori mais aussi il y a une partie privée et ça là toute façon vous pouvez faire l'introspection vous la verrez pas parce que toute manière vous n'êtes pas authentifié vous n'avez pas le droit de l'avoir . 4
16:48:000010:000010_1 : 16:47:41:806: Écoute pourquoi alors la première partie c'est comme on a dit vous récupèrez exactement ce que vous voulez donc pas de surprise y a pas deux je récupère trop de données par rapport à la page que j'affiche ou par rapport à l'application mobile il y en a pas j'en demande trop puisque bah dans ce cas là c'est de votre faute parce que concrètement vu que vous récupère exactement . 1
16:48:000011:000011_2 : 16:48:01:938: Prépa à cette donnée ou trop donné c'est qu'un moment votre requête est mal faite . 2
16:48:000012:000012_3 : 16:48:06:945: Le 2e sais que c'est assez facile de faire évoluer l'API donc j'en ai pas parlé là mais il est possible de déprécier des champs et donc en fait quand vous allez le récupérer le schéma d'introspection ça va être marqué que attention là vous êtes en train de vous êtes en train d'utiliser enfant qui va être déprécier donc ça n'empêche pas toujours de faire de la documentation . 3
16:48:000013:000013_4 : 16:48:24:069: Que c'est assez Volutis comme on peut rajouter des champs sans que ça casse parce que concrètement si vous avez rajouter un champ dans une ressource mais qu'elle n'a encore requête est nulle part mais ça veut pas dire que vous pouvez pas le faire ça veut dire que ça casse pas votre compte . 4
16:49:000014:000014_1 : 16:48:39:212: Et enfin . 1
16:49:000015:000015_0 : 16:48:41:334: En général à Solène. Graphql encore une fois ça dépend de votre architecture c'est pas parce que vous pouvez le faire en un seul et même endroit que vous êtes obligé de le faire ça veut juste dire vous avez la possibilité . 2
16:49:000016:000016_3 : 16:48:52:962: Heure du coup maintenant à parler un peu de graphène graphene pouces je sais pas si vous connaissez c l'implémentation de Piton de graphql . 3
16:49:000017:000017_4 : 16:49:03:380: Du coup on essaie de créer une petite une petite application TODO je sais que c'est pas un cas d'usage très très compliqué très complexe mais on va quand même on va quand même se prêter au jeu donc on va commencer par créer des mods . 4
16:50:000018:000018_1 : 16:49:19:526: Pouvez voir concret on définit de modèle donc dans du Django je sais pas si vous êtes tous amis avec jangot mais il se trouve que graphene son interface assez facilement avec . 1
16:50:000019:000019_2 : 16:49:28:682: Modèle avec un certain nombre de champs on les a ajouté à new model ensuite on va pouvoir créer schéma qui correspondent qui correspondent à CAC modèle donc là on peut voir que on a créé les deux types que vous avez vu tout à l'heure qui était dessiner . 2
16:50:000020:000020_3 : 16:49:47:814: Vraiment l'image de c'est assez facile parce que là comme je disais graphene se plug assez facilement dans Django et donc vous allez récupérer en fait au mot niveau de la payer exactement ce que vous avez défini dans votre modèle encore une fois c'est un choix d'architecture c'est-à-dire que si vous voulez pas exposer vos modèles directement vous n'êtes pas obligé vous pouvez très bien . 3
16:50:000021:000021_4 : 16:50:07:015: Très bien dire que bah ma base de donnée à la tête tête mais que concrètement je veux pas que mon shéma il copine à base de données j'ai pas besoin de tout ou j'ai besoin de faire un certain nombre de calcul ça ça voudra juste dire qu'à ce moment-là vous allez devoir définir des types qui sont différentes et ce sera à vous de faire les associations c'est juste que pour . 4
16:51:000022:000022_1 : 16:50:22:136: Présentation c'était plus facile de passer par ça . 1
16:51:000023:000023_0 : 16:50:25:106: Donc une fois qu'on a créé no type bah on a juste dit que dans notre schéma on allait avoir on a la voir des TODO et des listes mais concrètement on sait pas encore comme on peut le récupérer donc ça c'est liste et l'on va définir du coup des ----
16:51:000024:000024_2 : 16:50:26:106: Qui sont en fait qu'est-ce qu'on va pouvoir récupérer et donc là ce que vous voyez c'est le réseau tout doux ça permet de . 2
16:51:000025:000025_3 : 16:50:27:106: Si jamais je te demande en tout doux c'est comme ça qu'il faut que tu fasses donc comme je disais graphql et agnostique de skate sous ses il s'en fout il a pas besoin de savoir est-ce que je tape sur une base de données est-ce que potentiellement je tape sur une autre API est-ce que c'est du passé du mot aucun rapport le seul truc qui dois savoir c'est comment . 3
16:51:000026:000026_4 : 16:51:08:484: Au niveau du bakcend . 4
16:51:000027:000027_1 : 16:51:10:968: Une fois qu'on a fait ça on peut aussi faire par exemple dans la même chose pour les mutations et alors là . 1
16:52:000028:000028_2 : 16:51:20:086: Pouvez voir que c'est quelque chose d'assez simple parce que il se trouve que il y a des librairies qui permettent de récupérer de récupérer directement les objets de par exemple on peut leur passer dans ta face avec les CIRF et ça permet de créer des choses à se fasse assez facilement je mets un point d'attention si vous avez besoin de faire des choses compliquées . 2
16:52:000029:000029_3 : 16:51:39:236: Vous allez vite vous rendre compte que la magie noire qui a la marque beaucoup moins bien mais on en parlera un peu plus tard . 3
16:52:000030:000030_4 : 16:51:45:983: Donc une fois qu'on a créé nos modèles on a créé nos différentes nos différentes requettes et nos différentes mutations pour expliquer la comment traduisez les requêtes qui vont arriver sur le back-end on va pouvoir créer une classe avec le schéma au niveau du projet en fait on lui explique bah voilà moi je vais avoir je vais avoir 2 . 4
16:52:000031:000031_1 : 16:52:08:134: Les écoliers les mutations donc c'est-à-dire que par exemple si vous avez plusieurs d'applications vous pouvez toutes les toutes les importer la . 1
16:53:000032:000032_2 : 16:52:15:298: TODO schéma pour mutation là vous pouvez en à vous pouvez en ajouter à la pelle si vous avez 4 5 6 autant de models application dans votre dans votre projet django rien vous empêche de toutes les mettre là encore une fois ça c'est si vous voulez un seul point d'accès si vous en voulez plusieurs faudra en creer autant que vous voulez . 2
16:53:000033:000033_3 : 16:52:33:962: Une fois que c'est une fois que ça se fait on va pouvoir rajouter à dans le setting Django la librairie qui va bien et surtout lui spécifié mais où est-ce que je vais aller chercher mon schéma . 3
16:53:000034:000034_4 : 16:52:34:962: Sur la site d'avant on a mis un petit des blagues au milieu alors ça c'est assez pratique quand on développe ce que ça fait c'est que globalement on va avoir graphene qui va venir au médecin qui va venir au milieu des requêtes et qui va permettre entre autres quand vous faites vos requêtes dans . 4
16:53:000035:000035_1 : 16:52:35:962: De vous dire bah par rapport à la à la requête grave quel que j'ai envoyé voici le nombre de requêtes SQL que j'ai vu passer voici le temps de réponse exetera censé assez pratique notamment pour vous assurer que vous êtes en train de faire n'importe quoi . 1
16:53:000036:000036_2 : 16:53:18:493: Et après ben en fait classique Django on créer une API . 2
16:53:000037:000037_3 : 16:53:24:628: Et on peut commencer à jouer . 3
16:53:000038:000038_4 : 16:53:27:543: Du coup . 4
16:54:000039:000039_1 : 16:53:29:661: Si on regarde . 1
16:54:000040:000040_2 : 16:53:31:959: C'est graphiql une interface assez utilisé dans graphql donc il est disponible dans graphene mais aussi disponible par exemple si jamais vous voulez le faire sur un serveur note ce que ça fait c'est que ça vous permet de jouer avec la pays s'il y a une notion d'historique je vais essayer de . 2
16:54:000041:000041_3 : 16:53:53:338: Donc là ce que vous avez ce que de ce côté-là c'est qui s'appelle la documentation mais qui en fait est l'équivalent de mon shéma dans son introspection donc c'est hier que vous pouvez vous balader ou ballader dedans et regarder qu'est-ce qui est disponible qui sait que si jamais vous avez besoin d'informations et vous avez au niveau de l' environnement de développement un graphe . 3
16:54:000042:000042_4 : 16:54:14:473: Tu n'es pas forcément active en production attention mais vous avez les informations vous pouvez voir ce qu'il y a dans vous pouvez voir comment les vous pouvez vous balader dans est assez facilement savoir qu'est-ce qu'est-ce qu'il y a dans . 4
16:54:000043:000043_0 : 16:54:27:613: Mais non l'autre. Force et que . 1
16:54:000044:000044_2 : 16:54:37:744: Exemple . 2
16:54:000045:000045_3 : 16:54:39:891: Balade à côté . 3
16:55:000046:000046_4 : 16:54:42:019: Donc là faut savoir que il y a des petits trucs sympas c'est-à-dire que . 4
16:55:000047:000047_1 : 16:54:50:235: On a de l'auto-complétion . 1
16:55:000048:000048_2 : 16:54:51:235: Au lieu de récupérer identifiant aussi son mail . 2
16:55:000049:000049_3 : 16:54:59:559: Et du coup on les voit passer on peut ajouter le on peut ajouter le debug on peut ajouter son peux vraiment on peut vraiment jouer avec qui fait que c'est assez facile de jouer avec. 3
16:55:000050:000050_4 : 16:55:09:124: Exemple qu'on pourrait créer un utilisateur elle et lui dire que c'est pas possible parce que moi je l'ai déjà créez l'utilisateur qu'on préparation donc il fait parti des . 4
16:56:000051:000051_1 : 16:55:21:770: J'ai parti des utilisateurs que j'avais qu'on avait requis . 1
16:56:000052:000052_2 : 16:55:27:176: Regarde . 2
16:56:000053:000053_3 : 16:55:32:312: Du coup on voit que ça reste quand même assez agréable à utiliser . 3
16:56:000054:000054_4 : 16:56:01:489: Mais du coup . 4
16:56:000055:000055_1 : 16:56:05:000: Alors ça c'est un exemple de ce que vous pouvez faire au niveau du front alors faut savoir qu'au niveau du front il y a une librairie qui est particulièrement utilisée qui s'appelle Apollo il y a des implémentations dans un certain nombre de framework qui marche très très bien que ce soit React ou ViewJs je crois même qu'ils ont ils ont une librairie vanilla qui vous permet de faire . 1
16:57:000056:000056_2 : 16:56:26:137: réaction je crois même qu'ils ont ils ont une Emploi JavaScript si c'est ce que vous voulez faire sans avoir besoin de passer par un framework en particulier et du coup là par exemple c'est ce que j'écris c'est ce que j'ai écrit dans un projet de démo pour pouvoir permettre à un utilisateur de se loguer . 2
16:57:000057:000057_3 : 16:56:41:246: Non . 3
16:57:000058:000058_4 : 16:56:44:388: Donc là on récupère en fait c'est le récupère la mutation qui permet de gens qui permet de faire moi j'ai choisi de faire du JWT donc en fait on lui dit que la mutation pour se pour se loguer ça va être celle-là elle nous on va récupérer un token et en fait le token c'est du . 4
16:57:000059:000059_1 : 16:57:03:523: Le passe dans le header pour que la typiquement il y a des requêtes qui vont être protégé ou si l'utilisateur n'est pas authentifié ça va être un problématique d'ailleurs graphique elle est très pratique mais si vous avez l'authentification sur . 1
16:58:000060:000060_2 : 16:57:20:657: Sur vos mutation vous pourrez pas les faire avec un graphql parce qu'entre autre sur des choses vous avez utilisé les header HTTP il est fait pas donc pour ça il y avait un autre outil qui s'appelle Insomnia avec lequel vous pouvez jouer en fait voulu passer le header HTTP à chaque fois que vous faites une requete. 2
16:58:000061:000061_4 : 16:57:37:806: Comme je disais quand ça marche bien ça marche bien quand c'est facile c'est qu'on peut vraiment rapidement mettre en place une nouvelle une nouvelle application parcontre il y a quelques soucis . 4
16:58:000062:000062_1 : 16:57:52:980: Qui aujourd'hui ne sont pas forcément tous résolu vous avez premièrement les soucis d'authentification donc euh bah ça ça va être à votre ça va être avec backend de gérer comment il le fait vous allez avoir les notions de permission est-ce que j'ai le droit d'accéder à cette ressource est-ce que j'ai droit d'accéder à ce champ est-ce que en tant qu'utilisateur . 1
16:58:000063:000063_2 : 16:58:12:131: Vous avez les requêtes malicieuse comme on disait concrètement si demain je tape sur cette API et je fais je lui dis bah je veux la todo list je voulais TODO associés et en fait je dis que je suis pas un peu bête donc je vais passer sur je vais dans la dans le tout doux je vais redemander la to do list et puis dans la tu dis je vais redemander les tours . 2
16:59:000064:000064_3 : 16:58:32:269: doux associés et en fait je dis que je suis pas un peu con donc je vais passer sur je vais dans la dans le tout doux je vais redemander la to do list et puis dans la tu dis Sur son comme ça pour vous allez complètement avec l'attelle bakan parce que c'est pas c'est pour ça ça ça peut avoir des requêtes malicieuse ça va être des requêtes avec énormément récursion ça va des requêtes qui demande trop de temps de calcul donc ça il y a des y a des moyens de s'en prémunir mais encore une fois ça va être implémenter niveau back-end est actuellement graphene . 3
16:59:000065:000065_4 : 16:58:51:548: ils ont pas choisi de pallier à ces problèmes . 4
16:59:000066:000066_1 : 16:58:55:975: Mais du coup si on va un peu plus loin . 1
17:00:000067:000067_2 : 16:59:00:255: Est-ce que vraiment ça marche ou pas est-ce que aujourd'hui on production je l'utiliserai ben on va voir par exemple au niveau de la sécurité on peut mettre en place plusieurs choses pour être sûr qu'on va se prémunir minimum . 2
17:00:000068:000068_3 : 16:59:15:402: Par exemple là pour l'authentification étant donné que c'est à vous de la définir moi j'avais choisi de faire JWT mais si vous avez un autre chose ce sera a voulu implémenter donc vous pouvez utiliser graphene par exemple avec graphql JWT librairie vous pouvez mettre en login required au-dessus du résolveur utilisateur même passer la . 3
17:00:000069:000069_4 : 16:59:43:546: Vous choisissez par exemple je peux vous décidez de migrate application qui aujourd'hui du reste rien ne vous empêche pour le gué votre utilisateur passer par l'API REST jusqu'à un moment il faudra dire à Django qu'utilisateur a oublié le nom et donc utiliser le réseau pour vérifier . 4
17:00:000070:000070_1 : 17:00:00:687: Par exemple avec le avec grave que gwt on aura un truc qui ressemblera à ça donc pourrais vérifier le token lui demander et faire tout un tas de choses faut faire attention à ce niveau-là le la librairie permet pas encore de révoquer le token côté serveur donc c'est pratique mais ça peut avoir des ça peut avoir des feuilles de sécu pour faire un petit peu attention ça veut juste dire que le bal . 1
17:01:000071:000071_2 : 17:00:25:837: Par exemple avec le avec grave que gwt on aura un truc qui ressemblera à ça donc pourrais vérifier le token lui demander et faire tout un tas de choses faut faire attention à ce niveau-là le la librairie permet pas encore de révoquer le token côté serveur donc c'est pratique mais ça peut avoir des ça peut avoir des feuilles de sécu pour faire un petit peu De quel côté fonte au moment du le garde mais ça veut aussi dire que si on pique le token de votre utilisateur par un moyen X ou Y si vous n'êtes pas capable de le révoquer côté backen vous allez avoir quelques petits soucis . 2
17:01:000072:000072_3 : 17:00:38:090: Alors CORS qui normalement si vous l'avez mis en place en production vous dit que il y a une certain nombre d'URL et de domaines qui permet de taper sur votre à payer donc ça ça permet de se prémunir encore encore un petit peu de . 3
17:02:000073:000073_4 : 17:00:55:235: Problématique donc bah pour ceux qui sont déjà du reste Django CORS headers ça marche vachement bien continez à l'utiliser . 4
17:02:000074:000074_2 : 17:01:02:908: Alors ensuite ce que vous pouvez faire aussi c'est que comme j'ai dit on a des requêtes malicieuse donc les requêtes malicieuse concrètement va te problématique ça va être il va falloir potentiellement les arrêter avant qu'elle arrive au résolveur donc vous pouvez utiliser soit des middleware soin des contacte manager pour X ou Y je veux que j'en veux pas je la boot si ce que font que c'est qu'est-ce que c'est github c'est qu'en fait au moment où il voit passer la rocade graphql il calcule le évalue le temps tu vas mettre la requête et si elle dépasse un certain incertain coefficient ils disent non on n'en veux pas . 2
17:02:000075:000075_0 : 17:01:41:485: Mais du coup ça va vraiment pas là encore une fois ça va être à vous de le mettre en place ça va être à vous de définir vos propres d'outils et de décider qu'est-ce qui qu'est-ce qui vous va bien et ça va être il y a pas de il y a pas de solution magique ce qui sait que par exemple par rapport à tout à l'heure on avait les mutations
17:03:000076:000076_4 : 17:02:02:682: Utilisateurs authentifiés vous pourrez pas les utiliser vous allez vous allez avoir besoin de définir vos propres s Oliver et la d'ajouter de la logique donc ça va pas faciliter le développement de votre backend par rapport à des rêves doux de soucis c'est juste plus pratique côté parce que c'est un petit peu plus facile de se balader dans l'API . 4
17:03:000077:000077_1 : 17:02:21:715: Alors les tests ajouter des tests si vous en faites pas mais les tests c'est vachement pratique moi ce que en faisant j'ai fait plusieurs essais et ce que je préconise c'est plutôt plutôt de d'utiliser les requêtes du frontières que vous avez votre cerveau développeur au niveau du front teeth av de quelle ressource ils vont avoir besoin ils savent de quelle requête si . 1
17:03:000078:000078_2 : 17:02:42:913: Vous pouvez tout à fait vous en servir dans les tests en définition que sur tel pages jaunes sur tel sur tel type de résolveur on sait qu'on peut avoir les requêtes ABCD ça veut pas dire qu'il faut tout les mettre parce que sinon ça vous allez ajouter de la lourdeur et de la difficulté au moment du développement mais ça veut a minima dire que vous tester quand même votre aide . 2
17:03:000079:000079_3 : 17:03:03:019: Vous pouvez tout à fait vous en servir dans les tests en définition que sur tel pages jaunes sur tel sur tel type de résolveur on sait qu'on peut avoir les requêtes ABCD ça veut pas dire qu'il faut tout les mettre parce que sinon ça vous allez ajouter de la lourdeur et de la difficulté au moment du développement mais ça veut a minima Tu sais que si un moment vos tests ne passent pas ça veut dire de toute façon on va te rendre à péter au moment où vous mettez la la nouvelle version en Prod . 3
17:04:000080:000080_4 : 17:03:12:727: Là par exemple c'est ce que font GraphQL WTC qui met en place et permettre d'utiliser un ami de Loire pour les tests en disant bah je vais je vais juste ajouter un utilisateur de login qui vous permet par exemple de quand même pouvoir tester vos requêtes même si elles sont protégées par par le login . 4
17:04:000081:000081_1 : 17:03:32:176: Alors là on arrive au . 1
17:04:000082:000082_0 : 17:03:37:304: Quelle sécu ce qui se passe aujourd'hui c'est que si vous utilisez graphene Django et si vous voulez utiliser de la fin Django c'est très très bien si vous voulez faire du des applications simples malheureusement actuellement si vous avez des ForeignKey qui des ManyToMany qui se baladent dans vos modèles vous allez très très vite
17:05:000083:000083_3 : 17:03:59:435: Donc ça ça veut dire que ça veut pas dire que vous pouvez pas le faire ça veut juste dire que encore une fois la complexité va être déplacée dans les résolveurs donc si vous avez besoin de faire des cils selected pour vous assurer que tous les objets sont bien chargé au même moment ça peut être fait dans les résolveur par contre étant donné que vous pouvez voir passer un . 3
17:05:000084:000084_4 : 17:03:60:435: Le le fait de cacher ça va être assez content ça va ça va être un petit peu plus compliqué donc c'est qui avait fait une solution pour l'instant . 4
17:05:000085:000085_2 : 17:04:33:785: C'est le data-loader Et en gros ce que ça fait c'est une boîte un peu magique qui vous permet de récupérer des clés des identifiants et d'envoyer un peu moins de requête à la base de données et ça permet aussi de cacher c'est pas encore très très bien documenté ça marche pas encore tout à fait j'ai malheureusement Partie de retour c'est-à-dire que aujourd'hui grave c'est vachement bien je pense que c'est une technologie qui a de l'avenir en python ça permet de faire des choses assez facilement malheureusement le l'écosystème ai pas encore tout à fait mature aujourd'hui on est loin d'atteindre la maturité du de l'écosystème note et il y a plein de choses qu'on peut faire déjà plein de choses ça avance . 2
17:05:000086:000086_3 : 17:05:17:254: Graphene à ils ont commencé à faire leurs leur prochain donc graphene s'appuie sur un truc qui s'appelle graphql graphene core et en fait le il y a déjà le graphql graphene core next qui est en préparation qui va a priori remplacer grâce grâce à une chorégraphie actuelle et lui il vient déjà avec la notion d'abonnement tout un tas de choses qui sont que ça va mieux marcher et que ça . 3
17:06:000087:000087_4 : 17:05:40:376: Delastek qui a été qui a été créé par facebook mais on n'y est pas encore . 4
17:06:000088:000088_1 : 17:05:47:138: Dans l'Utah suivre les . 1
17:06:000089:000089_2 : 17:05:50:289: Du coup merci beaucoup les slides sont disponibles sur Github il y a un petit projet de démo qui permet de voir un peu bas à quoi ça ressemble si vous voulez regarder un peu plus haut un peu plus en détail j'ai essayé de mettre en place les la notion d'abonnement mais c'est un poil compliqué en ce moment. 2
17:06:000090:000090_3 : 17:06:09:057: En ce moment il y a différentes librairie qui se balader qui se battent les unes contre les autres et qui sont mieux en a qui sont plus tout à fait maintenu en a qui sont mais ça va venir je sais que c'est possible j'ai juste pas encore trouvé le moyen comment . 3
17:06:000091:000091_4 : 17:06:23:324: Voilà si vous avez des questions . 4
17:06:000092:000092_1 : 17:06:26:388: Oui . 1
17:07:000093:000093_2 : 17:06:36:540: Bah après . 2
17:07:000094:000094_3 : 17:06:41:712: Les codes d'erreur n'ont pas été a été abordés alors . 3
17:07:000095:000095_4 : 17:06:47:868: En plus rien quand je regarde là-haut mais c'est qui va se passer en fait c'est que les surtout les erreurs qui vont qui vont apparaître ça va être les erreur de type Jacques site envoie une mutation avec où tu sais que pour créer un utilisateur tu as besoin de son . 4
17:07:000096:000096_1 : 17:07:04:005: Aimer son password et que tu lui envoies pas ce qu'il va te répondre c'est que il y a un des champs qui manque en te disant bah écoute moi on m'a dit que enfin le type me dit que j' ai la mutation me dis je dois avoir ses de champs j'en ai pas l'un des deux il va juste te dire non c'est pas possible parce que j'ai parlant des de chant si tu lui passes par exemple quelque chose qui . 1
17:07:000097:000097_2 : 17:07:25:161: Mettre une chaîne de caractère il va te répondre la même chose à dire non mais là en ce moment là je vais en entier si tu me passes une chaîne de caractère ça marche juste pas . 2
17:07:000098:000098_3 : 17:07:32:256: Je vais voir si on peut . 3
17:07:000099:000099_4 : 17:07:36:625: Alors . 4
17:07:000100:000100_1 : 17:07:39:773: Par exemple . 1
17:08:000101:000101_2 : 17:07:42:471: Ouvrir ce truc là . 2
17:08:000102:000102_3 : 17:07:45:960: Voilà ça ressemble à ça . 3
17:08:000103:000103_4 : 17:07:50:129: Bah après GraphQL, non c'est pas du HTTP justement c'est-à-dire que ce qui se passe c'est que graphql c'est juste le c'est juste un langage de requête donc il se trouve que ce que vous envoyer CD blog de gisone est-ce que vous récupérez CD blog de gisone mais par contre c'est pas pour autant que ça se présuppose que vous utilisez HTTP de souci vous voulez . 4
17:08:000104:000104_1 : 17:07:52:129: N'importe quel autre protocole ça passe aussi le seul truc que ça dit c'est me la Roquette que j'envoie elle a t-elle tête la requête que je récupère a-t-elle tête au milieu ce que vous utilisez . 1
17:08:000105:000105_2 : 17:08:23:449: Non pas du tout . 2
17:08:000106:000106_3 : 17:08:27:621: Alors . 3
17:09:000107:000107_4 : 17:08:29:752: Là en fait la plupart sont les requêtes graphql son envoyé sous la forme je passe si on les voit . 4
17:09:000108:000108_1 : 17:08:36:631: Plan la voilà . 1
17:09:000109:000109_0 : 17:08:39:822: Voilà voilà tu sais c'est envoyé dans la rue qui s'est envoyé directement dans l'URL est globalement c'est un poste donc c'est pareil si vous utilisez de faire un gate avec la même chose sur un sur un âne. Graphql se trouve que graphene va vous dire que non ça marche pas . 2
17:09:000110:000110_3 : 17:08:55:432: Alors la question c'est est-ce qu'il y a un code d'erreur les arcades trop coûteuse alors comme j'ai dit requête trop coûteuse ça va présupposé que c'est le baptême qui la gère donc si c'est le baptême qui la gère c'est à toi de dire à l'erreur c'est ça mais du coup c'est pas implémenté dans graphe année c'est pas dans la spec ça c'est vraiment du ça c'est vraiment de le petit . 3
17:10:000111:000111_4 : 17:09:20:572: Pour être sûr que le service reste en bonne santé donc ça ça va être complètement à la décharge de l'équipe qui choisi de faire le bac . 4
17:10:000112:000112_1 : 17:09:27:997: Alors la question c'est est-ce que la spécification définit les codes d'erreur oui et non elle définit les codes d'erreur qui s'engage à dire qui tousse qui va être validation des types est-ce que la . 1
17:10:000113:000113_2 : 17:09:48:145: Amis au bonne endroit est-ce que la est-ce que le est-ce que sémantiquement la requête a du sens là où il y a des codes d'erreur qui sont dessinés typiquement c suite que vous avez . 2
17:10:000114:000114_3 : 17:09:58:160: C'est là-bas non il manque un argument par contre pour toutes les autres d'erreur ça va être ça va être backen de les implémenter . 3
17:10:000115:000115_4 : 17:10:06:811: Oui . 4
17:10:000116:000116_1 : 17:10:08:896: Alors la question c'est pour les pour les requêtes est-ce qu'on peut récupérer l'utilisateur c'est ça alors il se trouve que oui . 1
17:11:000117:000117_2 : 17:10:23:055: Il se trouve que oui donc par exemple dans graphene Django on peut utiliser le contact donc s'il y a des choses qui sont passés dans entre autre un utilisateur logué on peut le récupérer . 2
17:11:000118:000118_3 : 17:10:37:002: Alors la question c'est à dire que de préciser la notion de l'abonnement alors la notion d'abonnement c'est vraiment le principe c'est que . 3
17:11:000119:000119_4 : 17:10:56:124: L'utiliser surtout pour des endroits où on a besoin d'une mise à jour rapide et automatique du client donc typiquement ça va être on peut prendre l'exemple d'un chat on utiliserait pas forcément graphql pour le faire mais l'idée ça va être que j'ai un utilisateur qui va modifier quelque chose sur l'un des objets et je veux notifier les autres utilisateurs qui sont en train de travailler . 4
17:12:000120:000120_1 : 17:11:17:257: donc ce qui se passe en fait d'ailleurs c'est que c'est du WebSocket donc après tu pourrais par exemple il y a certaines librairie qui se bloque directement dans les modèles Django et qui défie qui permettent de définir une notion de l'abonnement à chaque fois qu'un modèle a été modifié à chaque fois que tu rajoutes un objet . 1
17:12:000121:000121_2 : 17:11:36:374: Typiquement ça va être l'exemple facebook j'ai j'ai mon ami à qui a posté qui a posté de tels telles informations je suis en train de je suis en train de le regarder et je vois les like et les commentaires au fur et à mesure donc là c'est le en fait ce que ça fait c'est qu'à chaque fois qui a quelque chose qui rajouter le serveur le serveur le vois note ici les clients qui sont connectés sur . 2
17:12:000122:000122_3 : 17:11:58:524: Et à ce moment-là le fontaine rajoute et recharge une recharge passant ça dépend de comment il est définit le contenu . 3
17:12:000123:000123_4 : 17:12:08:138: Vraiment pour faire de la mise à jour en direct . 4
17:13:000124:000124_1 : 17:12:11:819: Alors la question c'est est-ce que pour les requêtes en lecture il y a possibilité de faire des requêtes conditionnel alors qu'est-ce que tu appelles conditionnel déjà . 1
17:13:000125:000125_2 : 17:12:26:126: Alors . 2
17:13:000126:000126_0 : 17:12:34:271: Du coup le conditionnel est possible côté front tu peux très bien mettre des tu peux mettre des conditions dans le dans la Requette directement en disant que en fonction de par exemple une variable ou une variable b tu récupères tel ou tel champ ça c'est un premier. Le deuxième c'est qu'effectivement tu peux dire côté back-end que tu vas utiliser ou non quelle partie mais c'est ce qu'on dit . 3
17:13:000127:000127_4 : 17:12:59:419: Tu veux par exemple github une partie de l'API qui voit pas au même titre si tu as des si tu as des objets qui ne doivent pas être qui ne doivent pas être inquiété par un utilisateur Népal ok mais en fait ça revient à faire ce travail là après donc soit tu vas utilisé par exemple des choses comme le HAC login required qui peut être pratique mais après ça va être . 4
17:14:000128:000128_1 : 17:13:20:546: Superuser il a pas le droit de récupérer ses il a le droit de récupérer tous les champs Si mon utilisateur n'est pas supérieur je veux pas qu'il ait accès à ça parce qu'il a pas les permissions mais ça c'est la logique et à faire dans le résolveur donc si tu veux quelque chose de conditionnel ça va être à toi de le faire faut bien faut bien se rendre compte par contre . 1
17:14:000129:000129_2 : 17:13:21:546: Au niveau de l'introspection par . 2
17:14:000130:000130_3 : 17:13:41:911: Tu vas mettre fin ça va être plus difficile de travailler à partir de plus tu mets de choses qui ont des conditions plu ça va être compliqué et puis au moment du coup tu vas travailler sur le front il va falloir que bah par exemple tu es développeurs il soit tu superuser parce que concrètement si vois pas au niveau de la au moment l'introspection la totalité du schéma . 3
17:14:000131:000131_4 : 17:13:58:058: Ben ça va perdre un petit peu de son intérêt . 4
17:15:000132:000132_1 : 17:14:03:096: Alors alors lac . 1
17:15:000133:000133_2 : 17:14:26:138: Alors la question c'est pour la sécurité et pour la gestion des champs est-ce que il est possible de ne pas les exposés à la rouille encore une fois c'est le résolveur qui fait le boulot donc c'est-à-dire que à partir du moment où par exemple tu as récupéré l'utilisateur du contexte il y a absolument rien qui t'empêche de dire que quand je recupere par exemple on prenait . 2
17:15:000134:000134_3 : 17:14:46:278: Alors la question c'est pour la sécurité et pour la gestion des champs est-ce que il est possible de ne pas les exposés à la rouille encore une fois c'est le résolveur qui fait le boulot donc c'est-à-dire que à partir du moment où par exemple tu as récupéré l'utilisateur du contexte il y a absolument rien qui t'empêche de dire Moi si j'ai des to do list il est possible que je dois je ne puisse pas voir la to do liste de mes collègues ou la tout vidéo d'utilisateur mais ça c'est vrai ça Loire qui va aller les chercher au moment où toi tu vas définir ton par exemple tu dis que tu veux récupérer la totalité des to do list en tant que développeur tu sais qu'il y en a plus mais en tant qu'utilisateur tu veux . 3
17:15:000135:000135_4 : 17:15:04:519: Récupérer les tiennes en tout cas si je vais sur son profil au niveau du schéma d'introspection . 4
17:15:000136:000136_1 : 17:15:11:525: Alors ça c'est plus compliqué parce que le schéma l'introspection il va être récupéré être récupéré avec l'utilisateur courant donc c'est-à-dire que si tu prends le profil d'un utilisateur le schéma le schéma l'introspection que tu vas voir et le schéma que tu récupéreras mais ça va pas de présupposé que tu peux penser à papa n'a pas la documentation par contre rien ne t'empêche . 1
17:18:000137:000137_2 : 17:15:36:669: Et toi tu dessiner . 2
17:18:000138:000138_3 : 17:15:39:429: Deschamps . 3
17:18:000139:000139_4 : 17:15:41:648: Le préciser la . 4
17:18:000140:000140_4 : 17:18:08:624: Je viens que je recommence s'il te plaît . 4
17:18:000141:000141_1 : 17:18:12:237: Mahara question c'est est-ce qu'on peut faire des requêtes par exemple sur les listes c'est ça la . 1
17:19:000142:000142_2 : 17:18:24:183: Alors du coup la question c'est plus est-ce qu'on peut filtrer les les objets qu'on cherche oui on peut filtrer les objets qu'on cherche . 2
17:19:000143:000143_3 : 17:18:34:368: On pourrait dire moi je veux tous les tous doux mais uniquement de la liste avec la vie numéro 2 . 3
17:19:000144:000144_4 : 17:18:41:561: Du coup ça c'est possible après pour faire des filtres un peu plus custom IC en fait ils vont être déssiné au monde ou au niveau des résolveur 16h que au niveau de 1 ans pardon au niveau du type par exemple on peut récupérer un type 1 type d'un modèle et on peut lui dire que en plus de ça on va lui ajouter tel ou tel tel ou tel chant et du coup c'est ces gens qui ont . 4
17:20:000145:000145_1 : 17:19:02:699: Par exemple on pourrait ajouter un filtre combat lance dans un cue quelque chose dans Django et on ressort on restera pas envie on a d'appeler Core i7 en fonction de ça donc c'est possible mais ça c'est juste que ça suppose que il faut que un moment le chant filtre ils sont exposés donc soit Vial si tu sois . 1
17:20:000146:000146_2 : 17:19:21:804: Autrement soi ça va être en fait quelque chose qui est déjà dessiné ça ça va être quelque chose à ajouter donc par exemple il y a le facebook ils ont ils ont un fils a un tout petit peu plus loin que le graphql que j'ai présenté l'Aïd un truc qui s'appelle relais de faire la pagination la recherche des curseurs exetera et euh par exemple c'est un peu le défaut que le défaut de Grasse . 2
17:20:000147:000147_3 : 17:19:47:941: Autrement soi ça va être en fait quelque chose qui est déjà dessiné ça ça va être quelque chose à ajouter donc par exemple il y a le facebook ils ont ils ont un fils a un tout petit peu plus loin que le graphql que j'ai présenté l'Aïd un truc qui s'appelle relais de faire la pagination la recherche des curseurs exetera et euh par exemple c'est un peu le défaut que le défaut de Métisse implémenter uniquement pour rivets pour le moment mais ça permet de dire que je veux les quatre premiers je veux les cinq derniers je veux ce entre les entre le numéro de temps elle numéro temps ça permet un filtre un filtrage qu'un peu plus facile et apparemment trop de fer de la pagination mais c'est prêt implémenter si vous si vous utilisez riz lait avec Graffin . 3
17:20:000148:000148_4 : 17:20:08:207: Ne présuppose pas que vous pouvez pas le faire . 4
17:20:000149:000149_1 : 17:20:11:152: Oui . 1
17:21:000150:000150_3 : 17:20:25:002: Alors . 3
17:21:000151:000151_4 : 17:20:33:054: Alors la question c'est sûr comment concrètement en implémenter subscription c'est ça . 4
17:22:000152:000152_1 : 17:20:42:110: Les souscriptions ça va surtout être c implémente a beaucoup d'endroits avec du WebSocket donc par exemple ça moi j'ai regardé pas mal de libérer de librairie différentes quand j'ai préparé la conférence il y a des endroits où c'est dû à ce que pure il y a des endroits Océane elle s'utilise . 1
17:22:000153:000153_2 : 17:21:03:249: Malheureusement aujourd'hui la documentation et encore pas très présente il y a beaucoup de livres Éric icerde un peu à la même chose parce que ce sont des initiatives de personnes qui ont trouvé que le développement de graphène est un peu trop long et qui du coup on a essayé de créer leur propre truc comme je disais il y a le graphène cornex qui arrive qui a priori aura des . 2
17:22:000154:000154_4 : 17:21:23:418: Par contre pour tout ce qui est pour tout ce qu'il fera implémentation du serveur WebSocket a priori c'est pas encore tout à fait le cas il y a une librairie je crois qui s'appelle graphql WS qui se bloque dans du Chanel avec du Django mais j'ai pas eu le temps de creuser plus loin que ça parce qu'il se trouve que la doc est pas Code pour trouver comment faire fonctionner mais je sais que ça existe pourras pour être passé sur les il fut pour avoir regardé comment ça fonctionne dans le code c'est possible c'est juste que c'est Patricia . 4
17:22:000155:000155_2 : 17:22:04:449: Oui encore une encore une fois c'est ça alors ne la question c'est que pour la notion de subscription on fait pas de . 2
17:23:000156:000156_3 : 17:22:18:585: Ne présuppose pas dû de ce qu'on utilise pour le transport absolument comme je disais grave quel saint langage de requête tout ce qui présuppose c'est la tête et la réponse que tu que tu que vont avoir tes secrets . 3
17:23:000157:000157_4 : 17:22:30:489: Bon elles doivent elles doivent elles doivent avoir une certains certains aspects qui est défini dans les rêves c'est qui était publié par facebook que je vous invite oui ou que faire un kiné race et de je sais plus combien de pages où ils définissent exactement comment fonctionne le langage quels sont les types qu'est-ce qu'on peut faire avec comment paiement Télépro . 4
17:23:000158:000158_1 : 17:22:48:629: Si grave que le intéresse je vous invite à passer dessus même ne serait-ce que rapidement pour avoir une bonne idée de ce que ça fait mais effectivement comme Gizeh grave qu'elle ne présuppose pas du transport ça peut être dû HTTP sappadu abso 4 ça peut être qu'on se . 1
