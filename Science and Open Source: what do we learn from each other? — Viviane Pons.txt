Keynote #1 Science and Open Source: what do we learn from each other? â€” Viviane Pons

09:31:000041:000041_2 : 09:30:08:904: Hello everyone . 2
09:31:000042:000042_3 : 09:30:27:743: I want to check the you hear me well when I speak without the microphone here is it ok yeah . 3
09:31:000043:000043_4 : 09:30:38:450: First I would like to thank the organizers for inviting me today I have been hurt by Cannes France a few times and it's a great honour for me to be here today and to give this opening keynote so I want to talk about my experience both at the scientist and open source developer and what this two wolves bring to each other . 4
09:31:000044:000044_1 : 09:31:06:406: By introducing myself and explained just a little bit why I use Python in my work so I can see myself to be both a mathematician and a computer scientist . 1
09:32:000045:000045_2 : 09:31:21:779: I'm not sure I could say that I use a computer scientist mine to solve mathematical problems so I approach mathematics with an algorithmic point of view and waistcoat . 2
09:32:000046:000046_3 : 09:31:38:330: Be more specific my topic is cold air coming at her ex and to give you an idea that what it looks like . 3
09:32:000047:000047_4 : 09:31:48:684: Are actual research notes from a few years ago and to give you another idea that also what it looks like so this is Python code that I use in my day-to-day research so I won't go into details . 4
09:32:000048:000048_1 : 09:32:09:630: The basic idea about my research relies on code so anytime I write a research paper mathematics paper there is a program that . 1
09:33:000049:000049_2 : 09:32:22:157: Tom how are there in some experiments has been some code I'm experimenting on mathematical objects to find your results if you want to know more about that actually give a hole chokes when I explained that is called experimental pure mathematics using sage today is not the topic of the conference because I want to give you a more a broader view of the links that I . 2
09:33:000050:000050_3 : 09:32:47:266: Open source and science so I should start by saying that I am not the only scientist who showed . 3
09:33:000051:000051_4 : 09:32:57:236: A survey in 2014 amount UK academics and there's been shown that 92/:/ of the second AmEx use research software and from the person who did the survey he was saying himself well maybe VIII to send that we made it just didn't understand the questions so . 4
09:33:000052:000052_1 : 09:33:20:660: BBC many people who do research most people to research actually do stuff to it . 1
09:34:000053:000053_2 : 09:33:28:790: Percent say that the research would not be practical without with a software this is definitely my case I don't see how I can do mathematics if I don't have a computer . 2
09:34:000054:000054_3 : 09:33:39:531: 56/:/ say they develop their own software is also Mikey's in all those three cases . 3
09:34:000055:000055_4 : 09:33:47:585: Give you an idea of how how important writing code in code is important for research so this is like a survey is Crossfield so what about mathematics I don't have any specific numbers for mathematician I can just rely on my own experience from what I see around me most of my colleagues use computers at some level to do there to do the
09:34:000056:000056_1 : 09:34:16:697: P Money software for mathematicians so I went on Wikipedia and I find I found 39 computer algebra system listed so I put the main one here in this picture . 1
09:35:000057:000057_2 : 09:34:31:095: Have to understand that even so research happens inside research papers inside inside theorem it also happens within the software and with the code that not matching mathematicians right for the software . 2
09:35:000058:000058_3 : 09:34:49:093: All of the software open source Nokia 3 example . 3
09:35:000059:000059_4 : 09:34:55:079: Maple make magnetic and Nightmares TV . 4
09:36:000060:000060_2 : 09:35:24:177: My main motivation the reason I went to open so the reason I'm choosing Op is because to follow my to to to be when I want to be as a scientist to follow my values as a scientist I need to go up until this is where I find something that matches what I want to be as a scientist says it's values between science and open so this is what I'm going to describe now . 2
09:37:000061:000061_3 : 09:35:52:301: The other scientists the first day is I want to contribute so in a mother when I just pay some money and then I'm giving a software but I don't have I cannot even look what into software and I don't have a say about what's in the software I cannot be a part of it this is not a model that I like I don't want to be a simple user I want to be a Are the scientists I want to create knowledge and share it . 4
09:37:000063:000063_4 : 09:36:26:160: When I create new knowledge any new knowledge I create I want it to be available to everybody so I don't work only for me or for other academics I work for the public I am paid by the public to public money to do what I do I find that im very privileged to be paid to do something that I really love to follow my passion about Mathematics and I find that I it's my duty to g1r.gs 1
09:38:000065:000065_2 : 09:36:59:283: Back and in that sense I find that everything that I do should be made everything that I do to my work should be made public to everyone so this means that for example all my papers are accessible online so they are not open source and the reason they are not open to . 2
09:38:000066:000066_3 : 09:37:35:669: Any other academics you understand what I mean but let's say that I'm just doing my best so that everything that I write the mathematical counting that I write is accessible to everyone so all my teaching material is open source this is something that I've been doing for the last year's that every time I was creating you teaching material for you class you exercises anything . 3
09:38:000067:000067_4 : 09:37:59:905: What actually put everything on github . 4
09:38:000068:000068_1 : 09:38:04:060: And the final five . 1
09:38:000069:000069_2 : 09:38:08:173: Off-licence so that so it means that not only to students can have access to it but any other teachers and they know that they have the right to use it and that can't even contribute back to me telling me what what I can improve in my in my class . 2
09:39:000070:000070_3 : 09:38:26:049: Show me that all the code I write is open source the most of it goes into the software that I can that is going to stay tonight in which is there open source met medical software to someone that will do as actual contribution to the software I like it enters the Source Code some of it would be like external packages that people can install and most of it is actually just research . 3
09:39:000071:000071_4 : 09:38:49:182: I've taken the Habit now to put this even disco that is not finish not documented just kind of my own research code to put it also online with an open source licence so that everyone every other researcher who is my paper can just go and look at the attitude that I read . 4
09:39:000072:000072_1 : 09:39:09:300: As a scientist I collaborate . 1
09:39:000073:000073_2 : 09:39:14:424: I go to conferences I have International collaborators organise workshops organised seminars when I write a paper this paper is to friend is reviewed by other scientists so it's really not something that you do on your own sign into something that you do as a group so they invent collaborative aspect of open source is very natural for scientists to me it makes complete . 2
09:40:000074:000074_3 : 09:39:42:566: Actually I use the same tools I use get both for my scientific papers and for my account . 3
09:40:000075:000075_4 : 09:39:52:314: Mortlake on the more physical point of view the idea that we are joining forces to create something better is a motivation for both . 4
09:40:000076:000076_1 : 09:40:03:414: As a scientist I want my results to be reused and improved let's say I approve a new tier am so I publish a paper with a theorem and the proof it now becomes public knowledge so I knew mathematician can come and use this results to prove and use another serum they can also if there aren't they can rewrite my dear and maybe in
09:41:000077:000077_2 : 09:40:33:534: Fix a mistake maybe that are left in the original paper 2 science is not something that is fixed once and for all it evolves and improves of the time and I should say just like open Source Code . 2
09:41:000078:000078_3 : 09:40:49:023: Once again the idea that when I write something it's going to join a bigger frame where it's going to have its own life it's going to be improved and reused by Future developers and mathematicians this is something that I want and what I like about this is that I can be there in the next phase of the slice of my program on my paper but I don't have to it's going to happen I'm not I'm just leaving it for the future . 4
09:41:000080:000080_1 : 09:41:22:398: For all these reasons . 1
09:42:000081:000081_2 : 09:41:25:757: As a scientist I need to write a pencil skirt really after all I said I came to the conclusion that it is not possible for me to go back to writing something that would not be open source I would not be in line with my ethic as a scientist . 2
09:42:000082:000082_3 : 09:41:46:292: This process is my father's I heard it's something that other side is that had in the past and many other reach the same conclusion and I think it's not a coincidence that when you look at the story of open source it's some of it emerged from academia and I'm thinking of two specific person am going to example so we shall stand men who are the creator of GNU he was work . 3
09:42:000083:000083_4 : 09:42:16:417: Mighty . 4
09:42:000084:000084_1 : 09:42:18:543: The second example if someone's very well known to computer scientists and mathematicians is do not need and in particular he is the creator of the language take that is widely used in mathematics . 1
09:43:000085:000085_2 : 09:42:32:996: So now let's look at Malvern open and open so so basically as long as there's been the concept of open Source software we've had open sores med medical software . 2
09:43:000086:000086_3 : 09:42:47:675: No in the last decade or so it did not a lot and we have what we would call like a whole ecosystem of software that are open source for mathematician . 3
09:43:000087:000087_4 : 09:42:57:920: Gun shop specialist libraries I've put a few names years ago I specialise library is really something that is often the Blood by a small group of people and with main target is a subfield as mathematics so it's sizeable gap is for group computation group Theory . 4
09:43:000088:000088_1 : 09:43:20:053: Ronaldo persistence like sagemath which is the one that I know the most is the one I'm going to talk a bit more about later on . 1
09:44:000089:000089_2 : 09:43:29:165: We also use things that are meant for a wider group so interactive computing environments such as the iPad and Jupiter and the cool card platform . 2
09:44:000090:000090_3 : 09:43:43:069: Who is the author of The just a little bit in a big community of for example society6 dieting and decided generally open till science . 3
09:44:000091:000091_4 : 09:43:55:192: So I'm going to talk a bit more about the Sage max out through the official name is stage mad but I'm off and going to say only stage . 4
09:45:000092:000092_1 : 09:44:08:308: It all started in 2005 by a mathematician poet William started the story is quite interesting he was actually writing a lot of code before and it was writing is not that serious and he was writing the code in a software called magma and my mum was one of the examples that I gave you earlier it's not open source and at some point I think he reached the same conclusion that I had before . 1
09:45:000093:000093_2 : 09:44:35:427: The frustration that he was writing code for a property software and he had no say on the software itself and everyone who wanted to use this code had to get the bag my licence and he sounds really even that this was going nowhere that you was losing its time doing that and that's why I decided to create SageMath which was a big step quiz he had to make it from whatnot so nothing actually be . 2
09:45:000094:000094_3 : 09:45:01:552: Already many other those libraries specialises already existed for the first thing that he did but that he took everything that existed that was open source and include them with Python so he created a python interface that allows newcomers to just take whatever they needed in the different libraries in work with it and by the way this was one of the first use of the . 3
09:46:000095:000095_4 : 09:45:31:688: At the time I Python at terminal was when we won stage West Croydon . 4
09:46:000096:000096_1 : 09:45:40:069: You managed to create something that was good enough that all those people started to join and it grew out of this many libraries glued together with Python a druid its own libraries in Python and also in this item on top of it and it grew a horse vibrant community so . 1
09:46:000097:000097_2 : 09:46:06:190: 271 contribute as listed on the stage website on the on the map . 2
09:46:000098:000098_3 : 09:46:15:317: The way . 3
09:46:000099:000099_4 : 09:46:17:751: And what about me as oyster I joined . 4
09:47:000100:000100_1 : 09:46:25:871: Doing research in 2010 and I was doing networks and it turned out that my people my groups networks they just had decided to move to say to say when I say move to say what I mean is that they used to also write code together they was already disclosure of sharing code among people in coming out works but they didn't have an open source solution so they were . 1
09:47:000101:000101_0 : 09:46:52:027: Show me the way using a software called moped that now mostly disappeared and they had the same problem. William starting heard that they were writing code for a software on which they had no control and which was not open source so they took this decision to move to say so they basically translated a bunch of code into sage and when
09:47:000102:000102_3 : 09:47:17:153: Sage native if I sent that I started doing research wife's age was already good enough that I could use it and it's the only research software that I've used to do my research and I'm really happy about it . 3
09:48:000103:000103_4 : 09:47:33:838: Ok so I've told you about the love story that is between open source and sides and no I want to share a bed what are the challenges that we face and I think they are very similar . 4
09:48:000104:000104_1 : 09:47:50:664: The main problem we have with open source in science is we need funding recognition and sustainability and I'm saying that for Open Source Project in science but I'm pretty sure this is a problem that any Open Source Project would have this question is who pays for the project so I said earlier ok when you have a property software you have to pay this licence when you go to open to . 1
09:49:000105:000105_2 : 09:48:15:800: It's free it's not free because they are people working on the software so who pays them if you don't pay the licence and that's an actual problem because most of an in in science most of this is actually done by researchers we take this from their research time in the question is how is a devil of my word said in the community this time that you put two software valued in . 2
09:49:000106:000106_3 : 09:48:41:931: And this lead to do hard reset software going to survive because if you don't pay for software and if you don't value the work then the work is not going to get down and the software was that whether it's open source of not . 3
09:49:000107:000107_4 : 09:49:01:547: So let's look back at the same as development model so the main idea is for users by users so we are encouraged as write it to write code only when it's used for own research ok that's good but that means we need to better economic conditions for research software development because at the moment is not if your right to hold baggage about optimisation of factories in . 4
09:50:000108:000108_1 : 09:49:02:547: Is not going to be as good in your CV as if you had done a few papers on the subject so we need to value this work from research or when they try to put the work into software . 1
09:50:000109:000109_2 : 09:49:44:471: The only problem because it's good to write research showed that what about the rest of the code who did the dirty work and when I say dirty with this is what I mean . 2
09:50:000110:000110_0 : 09:49:58:799: Paying into faces install scripts Lola lo software interaction this out tasks that are that has no recent value and high technical value so basically if you don't get recognition for writing research code you really get absolutely nowhere condition as a software the blob as a research as a researcher when you write this because it is
09:51:000111:000111_4 : 09:50:26:954: Job to do it so I thought this number here so we said that 56/:/ of academic they love their own software but only twenty one percent . 4
09:51:000112:000112_1 : 09:50:36:107: 56 received a proper training in software development so basically it's not our job to do this technical test and we're not really good at it so if I look at myself I have been training software development but I am not the best person to do that because I don't want to do that because my main thing is research and I don't want to take my research time to to do this code . 1
09:51:000113:000113_0 : 09:51:03:239: Most qualified to do it so we need all the people in this other people they are called research software engineers and we really need those people with us so it means engineers weather true interest for research and want to work in up and sitting in academia but you get this people that people exist but we need also to be able
09:51:000114:000114_3 : 09:51:28:365: Career prospects and some flexibility of a timer mission to that when someone works when we recruit an engineer's he can he or she can work on whatever projects that we need at the moment and this can evolve over time . 3
09:52:000115:000115_4 : 09:51:44:138: Sing as we are working on very hard we try hard to convince or institutions or government that open source user driven development is the good way to go . 4
09:52:000116:000116_1 : 09:51:56:256: Sustainable funding to function sometimes we're making progress so . 1
09:52:000117:000117_2 : 09:52:06:293: 2015 we launched this project open gym kit which stands for open did you tell research environment Toolkit for the advent advent of Mathematics so basically it's a project that supports open source in mathematics for many different software . 2
09:53:000118:000118_3 : 09:52:25:528: So this was . 3
09:53:000119:000119_6 : 09:52:28:651: From a European call for me Eurovision 2020 European research infrastructure work program so it's really good that we managed to get this because it mean it mean that we convince your app that when we were doing was good then that it was worth giving money to so we receive the budget of 7.6 million and it was run by a team partner institution in 7 countries this morning was used to . 4
09:53:000120:000120_1 : 09:52:29:651: Junior Air Force age and also for Jupiter and for all the software and also to pay on time as researcher when we were working on the project and also to pay for conferences and workshops . 1
09:53:000121:000121_2 : 09:53:12:836: It started in 2015 it ends in 2019 . 2
09:53:000122:000122_3 : 09:53:19:652: Next . 3
09:53:000123:000123_4 : 09:53:21:367: That's a question why I don't have an answer so one thing I could do as I could apply for a new project but then . 4
09:54:000124:000124_1 : 09:53:30:650: It would the air if I don't want to spend my whole time applying for a project and managing European Projects so there is something here that we have to guess where we had to make the most progressive as we have to convince this institution that is not something that we do for 4 year project and then another four-year project is something when we need sustainability and we need to be . 1
09:54:000125:000125_2 : 09:53:53:775: Do you offer a permanent jobs to the Twitter ginger news . 2
09:54:000126:000126_3 : 09:53:57:901: List the first thing I want to talk about another thing another challenge which is more from within our own communities . 3
09:54:000127:000127_4 : 09:54:08:392: Equity and diversity . 4
09:54:000128:000128_1 : 09:54:12:566: How to work within our self . 1
09:54:000129:000129_2 : 09:54:15:904: We need to develop software for everyone with everyone I think the sentence should mean something for any open source of Robert this is the reason why we chose open source is in that like to work with everyone for everyone and at the moment I think putting your code on github with an open source licence Is Not Enough . 2
09:54:000130:000130_3 : 09:54:35:959: So let me give you some numbers that are interesting . 3
09:54:000131:000131_4 : 09:54:41:091: Turn off Windows users 93/:/ off Linux users use research software for not such a big difference there . 4
09:55:000132:000132_1 : 09:54:49:803: Can we come to development 41/:/ of Windows users and 90/:/ of wind . 1
09:55:000133:000133_2 : 09:54:55:925: Pictures of develop software . 2
09:55:000134:000134_3 : 09:54:59:070: Difference in . 3
09:55:000135:000135_4 : 09:55:01:195: The most of the people to develop that I see you either or Linux or mac and this goes to this is where we see something like the native Windows sage might install being done only in 2017 even so we have so many users who are on Windows . 4
09:55:000136:000136_1 : 09:55:18:919: This was sent to or engineers recruited by up and drink it but it's very late though we had it . 1
09:56:000137:000137_3 : 09:55:19:919: teaching stayed in many places such as I've been to Uganda and Colombia and other day I met some students and most of them were on windows and none of them had heard of ovens . 3
09:56:000138:000138_4 : 09:55:53:496: This is for the student that I want to develop see this as a students who need it the most because then she just cannot bear for the licences and the students are the ones that are still deployed from it because we don't care about the money enough . 4
09:56:000139:000139_1 : 09:56:09:160: Another number . 1
